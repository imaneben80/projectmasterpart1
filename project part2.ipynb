RI.SE has a long tradition of hosting interesting open houses, both as RI.SE and in their previous guide as SiCS. The day was a mix of organized talks in the morning, and an open house where RI.SE researchers showed off their work in the afternoon. Most of the AI discussions were related to large language models (LLMs), but not all. I got some new insights about LLMs in general and using LLMs for coding in particular.Continue reading“RI.SE AI Day – More on LLMs (and some)”AuthorJakobPosted on2023 September 17CategoriesAI/ML,conferences,programmingTagsartificial intelligence,ChatGPT,CNN,Deep learning,Edward Chi,Google,Google Bard,Henry Tirri,King,large language model,Sahar Asadi,SiloGenLeave a commenton RI.SE AI Day – More on LLMs (and some)Adventures Traveling to and from ItalyThe big family vacation his summer was a cruise in the Mediterranean.

The CPU load did not quite go as high as I am used to – typically, compute-intense run should get close to 100% processor load using a single host thread to execute the simulation. Instead, I got to no more than about 50%, which was decidedly odd. I also had a screenshot from a few days earlier that showed some 90% CPU load. Turns out the culprit was a combination of factors, including the Windows 11 scheduler and the Corsair iCUE software pack.Continue reading“That’s Odd: How iCue and Windows 11 Ruin Simics Performance”AuthorJakobPosted on2023 July 122023 July 12Categoriescomputer simulation technology,desktop software,off-topic,programming,virtual platformsTagscorsair,icue,keyboard,performance,scheduling,Simics,Windows 11Leave a commenton That’s Odd: How iCue and Windows 11 Ruin Simics PerformanceIntel Blog: Playing with Instruction Sets in the Public Simics RISC-V PlatformAs noted previously, thePublic Release of the Intel Simics Simulatorhas added a simple RISC-V virtual platform.In mysecond blog post about the platform, I reconfigure the instruction set, crash Linux, debug the issue, and reconfigure the software to match the hardware.AuthorJakobPosted on2023 June 292023 July 14Categoriescomputer architecture,Intel Blog,virtual platformsTagsinstruction set architecture,Intel Blog,linux,RISC-V,Simics,virtual platformsLeave a commenton Intel Blog: Playing with Instruction Sets in the Public Simics RISC-V PlatformIntel Blog: Public Simics RISC-V Simple Virtual PlatformThe 2023-19 version of thePublic Release of the Intel Simics Simulatoradded a simple RISC-V virtual platform.

There is one more aspect left to consider – the legal and licensing side. I am not a lawyer, I am not an expert, but it seems obvious that there is a huge problem. There are also clear questions about business morals and what the right thing to do would be. I also doubt the business viability of LLMs in the way they are currently trained.Continue reading“ChatGPT and Legal”AuthorJakobPosted on2023 April 122023 April 16CategoriesAI/ML,off-topicTagsChatGPT,copyright,GPT4,large language model,napster,open-source,software licensing,spotify,Stable DiffusionLeave a commenton ChatGPT and LegalChatGPT and CritiqueChatGPT and other transformer-based models like Dall-E are technologically very impressive.

However, they are not really generally intelligent, and there are innumerable problems with how they work, what they do, what people think they do, ethics, and legal and licensing issues.

Not unsurprisingly it did not do all that well. However, one area where ChatGPT appears to really work well is when dealing with program code. This seems more practically useful as well, especially as a generator of starting points and boiler-plate code. It can also sometimes do a decent job explaining code, subject to quite common bizarre mistakes and errors.Update:Part 3,  a critique of ChatGPThas been published.Continue reading“ChatGPT and Code”AuthorJakobPosted on2023 March 22023 April 1CategoriesAI/ML,off-topic,programmingTagsartificial intelligence,assistant,C,ChatGPT,coding,github,github copilot,GPT3,GPT3.5,large language model,machine learning,Mandelbrot,python1 Commenton ChatGPT and CodeChatGPT and SimicsIt is an understatement to say thatChatGPThas been a hot topic since it was launched a few months back.

This is a seriously fast machine in a fairly compact package, even though admittedly not as small as the old NUC5.

Such was first the case in 1969 when, on the eve of an anticipated U.S. tour, the band effectively fired its drug-addled founding member, Brian Jones—he was soon found dead in his swimming pool—in favor of lead guitarist Mick Taylor, arguably the most proficient guitarist the Stones had ever held in their ranks. Six years later, Taylor quit, leaving the door open for the Faces’ amiable Ronnie Wood to pick up the slack. Finally, after the Stones finished their round-the-world tour in support of their 1989 LPSteel Wheels, original bassist Bill Wyman retired, leaving an unenviable space to fill. A lesser band would have called it quits.Rather than packing it in, however, the Stones still continued to roll, recruiting bassist Darryl Jones—the formidable musician’s credentials included live and session work with the likes of Miles Davis, Eric Clapton, Sting, and Madonna—to round out the lineup (though, unfortunately, not as an official member). With Jones in tow, the Stones suitably stepped up their game on their subsequent album, 1994’sVoodoo Lounge, arguably their strongest since 1978’sSome Girls. Perhaps the acquisition of Jones inspired this improvement, or maybe the band’s thirtieth anniversary compelled the remaining members to harken back to former glories; regardless,Voodoo Loungerepresented a solid step up for the“world’s greatest rock ’n’ roll band.”Road tested on the concert stage is where such efforts live or die, though, and with a massive tour in support ofVoodoo Lounge, the Stones—including their latest recruit in Jones—laid it on the line.On a late-November night at Miami’s Joe Robbie Stadium, the band more than demonstrated its mettle, the chemistry between the old guard and the new blood coming across with fearsome, raw power.Voodoo Loungesongs like the seething sleaze of “Sparks Will Fly,” the punk-like punch of “You Got Me. Rocking,” and the achingly forlorn Keith Richards ballad “The Worst” are indeed redeemed here, summoning both potency and edge.Mick Jagger flits, slithers, and struts across the end-zone-wide stage, proving why he is rock’s most charismatic frontman. Other highlights include bothrarities (“Rocks Off” “Monkey Man”)and ballads (“Beast of Burden,” “Angie”), not to mention the usual warhorses (“Sympathy for the Devil,”“Miss You,”“Brown Sugar,” “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” etc.), making for an ecstatically fantastic performance and an overall searing document of a stellar Rolling Stones tour.Read on...February 21, 2018Book Review: Reinventing Pink Floyd: From Syd Barrett to The Dark Side of the MoonByDonald GibsonBill Kopp,book review,David Gilmour,Nick Mason,Pink Floyd,progressive rock,psychedelic,Richard Wright,Roger Waters,Syd BarrettNo commentsFor more than half a century Pink Floyd produced some of the most fabled and successful albums in popular music history yet the singular British band has nevertheless remained, at least in some respects, an enigma.Much of that enigma surrounds Syd Barrett, the Floyd’s principal songwriter and eccentric visionary behind the band’s earliest efforts. The music he created with Pink Floyd in the mid-to-late sixties—enriched by his distinctly puerile songwriting style and psychedelic eccentricities—contrasts so boldly from the music the Floyd made following his termination from the lineup in 1968 so as to sound like a different band altogether. Even still, Barrett’s legacy loomed over the band (bassist Roger Waters, keyboardist Richard Wright, drummer Nick Mason, and Barrett’s replacement, guitarist David Gilmour) for decades thereafter.InReinventing Pink Floyd: From Syd Barrett to The Dark Side of the Moon, author Bill Kopp reframes the band’s legendary oeuvre by surveying those earliest efforts to illustrate how they presaged and ultimately informed the Floyd’s most celebrated subsequent discography beginning with 1973’sThe Dark Side of the Moon. He delves deep, for instance, into the band’s nascent recording sessions and performances, including early studio albums like 1967’sThe Piper at the Gates of Dawnand 1968’sA Saucerful of Secretsas well as experimental forays into film-soundtrack recordings.Kopp exerts a keen perspective throughout, contextualizing each project by dissecting each one’s artistic direction with the knowledge of one who is not only intimately familiar with the band’s expansive output but with rudimentary music principles as well. Such explanations never succumb to sounding too technical or abstract for casual fans to appreciate, thankfully, as Kopp offers just enough expert analysis to enlighten—rather than overwhelm—the reader. Overall,Reinventing Pink Floydsheds light on a pivotal and all-too-often overlooked era of one of the all-time great bands just as it was evolving into an undisputed commercial hit-making\\xa0 behemoth of progressive rock. Highly recommended.Read on...May 07, 2017An Interview with Tom PaxtonByDonald Gibsonartist interview,Bob Dylan,folk,folk music,interview,Judy Collins,singer/songwriter,songwriting,Tom Paxton,Willie NelsonNo commentsIn a career spanning more than half a century, GRAMMY®-winning folk legend Tom Paxton has composed a veritable goldmine of American music. Instilled with an activist’s passion and a storyteller’s finesse, his songs—which have been covered by the likes of Bob Dylan, Judy Collins, and Willie Nelson—resonate with melodies as endearing as nursery rhymes and narratives affirming an intimate conscience.With his latest album,Boat in the Water, Paxton, 79, continues to articulate his craft in such inimitably empathetic ways.Can you sense how your songwriting has evolved over the years?Well, that’s an interesting question. I’ve always likened myself to a farmer with a field, and each year he plants a crop in that field and with luck harvests it in the fall. In my case, I plant different crops but it’s in the same field and it’s the same farmer. So I don’t find that I write different songs from the ones I wrote at the age of twenty-five, but I hope that now and then I write a song that I was not capable of writing at the age of twenty-five. But they’re not that different. They’re still the same sound to them, people tell me.The writer is the last one to be able to identify his own songs, but they tell me that a song can be recognized as being likely from me. I accept that’s true because I can certainly identify a song as probably written by Dylan or probably written by Leonard Cohen. There’s a style, there’s a sense to it. So, I don’t think I write differently—it’s the same brain, the same right hand—but perhaps there might be a depth to the songs now that there wasn’t then. I don’t know. I certainly don’t try to write differently than I wrote [back then]. I don’t know what that would sound like.When you’re writing a song, do you have any audience in mind?Oh, sure. Without being able to put a face to it, it’s the same group of people I’ve sung to for fifty-six years. They’re good people and we see a lot of things through the same lenses, and it’s really primarily for myself as a singer that I write the songs. But it’s also [for] the people that have been with me for years and years and years that I write. If not for them I might just keep it to myself and say, “I don’t have to write it. I already know that.” It is for the people who come to my shows that I write the songs.Is it disillusioning if the audience doesn’t quote, unquote “get it”?No, it does not. I feel like I’m responsible for what I do and what I release and I’m not responsible for how it’s received or poorly received. And so, I don’t worry about that. I just worry about getting it right for myself, to make sure it’s clear and musical and I hope entertaining, but at least engrossing; that people know that it’s sincere, that it’s a deliberate work of art. It’s not the work of a dilettante. It’s the work of someone who’s been doing it a long time and cares very much about doing it well.You are revisiting some of your older songs onBoat in the Water. What was the reason behind that? What did you think you could bring to them at this stage in your life that maybe you didn’t the first time around?Well, part of it was a conversation I had with producer, Cathy Fink, who’s an old, old friend. She said, “I’d like to hear these songs again.” She’d been listening to a bunch of my old records and she said, “You know, that song ‘Life’ is a wonderful song and I’d like to hear it again. Let’s put it on here.” I said, “Sure.” And I did the same thing with “Evry Time,” [which] is a song I think I wrote in 1962. It’s certainly one of the oldest recordable songs that I have, and I’ve sung it in a lot of soundchecks and a lot of dressing rooms. So I said, “Let’s take another shot at this one.”Did it resonate any different with you?Oh, I love the song. To me the song is really an evocation of my early love for the songs that Burl Ives used to sing. He used to sing lots of songs that did not have a steady beat to them, a lot of the old Appalachian songs that he used to sing. It was just kind of my homage to that kind of song and I’ve always loved it. It’s just a very simple song. It only has two verses to it, but it seems like a complete song to me.In light of some of the songs you write that are critical of certain social or political ills, how do you manage to salvage the compassion and sense of grace and beauty that comes through in some of the other songs you write?That’s not too difficult, actually. Each song is its own message. Each song has its own parameters. I don’t bring a political sense to a personal song. I also write songs that I hope will amuse a seven-year-old child. You bring the tools to the project that the project requires. And if you’re writing a song to amuse a seven-year-old boy, you include irreverence and a sense of fun, a sense of the ridiculous. You don’t bring a sharply tuned social mind whereas, if you’re writing a song satirizing a president who is an egregious liar, you don’t bring the same vocabulary that you use with the seven-year-old boy’s song. You bring a different vocabulary, a different sensibility. They’re all different songs and I tend to take them as the ideas come to me. The idea will come to me of something ridiculous and fun and rather innocent and I’ll go ahead and write that song and hope that it finds that seven-year-old boy or girl and amuses them. If I’m satirizing the president, I’ll use a different box of tools. Each song has its own perfection that you strive for.So, writing a song in which you would satirize the president or critique certain social ills doesn’t compromise the compassion that is required to write the other songs?No, I never write a song that denies the other songs I write. There’s no underlying similarity. I mean, they all come from the same fella, and I’m not going to write a song that directly contradicts any other song I’ve written. There’s got to be a consistency. Even if I’m writing a funny song for kids, I’m not going to say something in that song that I don’t believe.Is songwriting a discipline that you return to all the time? Are you always receptive to new ideas?Yeah, I find the ideas come pretty regularly. There’s a kind of a receptive frame of mind that I seem to be a little more able to slip into now than maybe I used to be. I know that working with [co-songwriters] Jon Vezner and Don Henry is good for me. We just finished four dates out in the West and shortly before those dates I heard a melody from Jon. I said, “Give me a tape of that.” And I turned it into a song which we put in the shows out in California and it really went down beautifully. And while we were sitting in a dressing room in Berkeley, he was doodling around on the ukulele and he struck a chord and I said, “Whoa, what was that?” He played it again, and I sang a silly little phrase that is turning into a delightful little ukulele song. I’m always on the lookout, so to speak.Do you ever fear giving too much of yourself away in what you write?Oh, no. No, I don’t feel that at all. I do write personally but it’s usually not as Tom Paxton. I use the first-person singular a lot because it’s more suitable for songs, I think, to be personal like that. But it’s very seldom that it’s Tom Paxton who’s being personal. It is the narrator in the song who’s sharing, but of course it’s always the writer who is easily identifiable. But I think I just kind of shrink from making Tom Paxton the subject of Tom Paxton’s song. It seems to me to be such an egotistical thing to do. I just thought of a way of putting it: I’m a ham, but I’m not a show-off.Read on...January 30, 2017The Deep End of Pete Townshend's GeniusByDonald GibsonDavid Gilmour,DVD review,John Entwistle,Keith Moon,Pete Townshend,Roger Daltrey,Rolling Stones,The WhoNo commentsPete Townshend was always too ambitious for rock ‘n’ roll.Not so much with the early hits he wrote for The Who, songs like “Can’t Explain” and “Substitute,” which were in essence point-and-click snapshots of the lives Townshend observed around him—songs that in turn gave the band’s youthful audience a collective voice and culture of its own. More so, rather, with the emergence ofTommyin 1969, when Townshend broadened his creative sweep into the realm of a rock opera, crafting songs with narrative themes and psychologically complex characters that when presented together achieved even more prescient significance.Evolving from a singles-oriented band to one which makes long-form albums was not a particularly innovative shift in and of itself, of course. By the same year asTommy’s soundtrack release, the Rolling Stones had likewise moved on from casting such succinct aspersions of British society as “Mother’s Little Helper” and “Get Off My Cloud” to pursue grander (and darker) subject matter on such LPs asBeggars BanquetandLet It Bleed.What Townshend as the prime songwriting conduit in The Who was doing by this point, however, signified more than a mere intention to broaden a musical idea or even to render an album as some sort of cohesive piece of work. Townshend composed character sketches and thematic motifs, implemented plot devices and narrative constructions like a novelist or playwright, his lyrics laying the foundation that he and his bandmates—bassist John Entwistle, drummer Keith Moon, and vocalist Roger Daltrey—would then galvanize into song.Townshend could be obsessive about his art, but who could blame him? The expectations he unwittingly created—the benchmarks he and the band set in the studio, the mythologized behemoth The Who became on the concert stage—became a lot to live up to, with Townshend’s reputation as a songwriter dictating ever more genius with each new piece of music.In the throes of composing his most aspirational project yet,Lifehouse, Townshend grew increasingly overwhelmed and disillusioned, his intended magnum opus crumbling under his own madcap perfectionism. Scrapping all but the script, so to speak, the band’s producer Glyn Johns salvaged what he deemed the project’s strongest songs, culminating with the 1971 LPWho’s Next. An unmitigated classic, the album—which included a veritable haul of ageless warhorses like “Baba O’Riley,” “Behind Blue Eyes,” and “Won’t Get Fooled Again”—offered perhaps the most ironic affirmation of Townshend’s artistic prowess.Only two years later Townshend redeemed himself withQuadrophenia, yet the specter of theLifehousedebacle loomed over his head for decades to come. In fact, he didn’t putLifehouseto bed for good until 1999 with the sprawling, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink box set,Lifehouse Chronicles—which, conspicuously, was credited not to The Who but to Pete Townshend.And therein lies the crux of Townshend’s songcraft. For all the democratization that often makes a band better than the sum of its individual parts, Townshend’s best ideas came out of working alone. Sure, his initial ideas were then retooled and rearranged and implemented by one of the most ferocious rock bands on the planet. But the most crucial atoms of those classic Who anthems originated out of Townshend’s imagination.Without the concerted collaboration of his band to shape his musical ideas, Townshend’s solo work (which he experimented with in the ‘70s before taking far more seriously in the ‘80s with albums like 1980’sEmpty Glassand 1982’sAll the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes) seemed to be an endeavor wholly distinct from The Who.Which is why, when on January 29, 1986, Townshend and a big-band ensemble dubbed the Deep End rolled into Cannes for a performance for the popular German television seriesRockpalastin support of his solo album from the year before,White City: A Novel, the overriding impression—as witnessed on the Blu-ray and CDPete Townshend’s Deep End: Face The Face—is one of liberation.Boasting a five-piece brass cotillion and five backing vocalists, a - write on music in-depth artist interviews, music criticism, and select music news and downloads\",\n",

At the deadline, they really did neither. Their only change was to bring in right-handed relief pitcherKeynan Middleton(from the Chicago White Sox) for another right-hander from their farm system,Juan Carela.And by the end of August, as they were out of contention and the rosters were due to expand, they decide to do a little cleaning house. Predictably but expensively, they cutJosh Donaldson. Also going through the out door wasGreg Allen, who wasn’t being used much, but did bring something to the team. More surprisingly, they placedHarrison Baderon waivers.Let’s see what else happened:Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|Taggedaaron judge,analysis,anthony rizzo,anthony volpe,austin wells,baseball,ben rortvedt,billy mckinney,bronx,bronx bombers,chicago,cincinnati,cincinnati reds,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,dj lemahieu,everson pereira,giancarlo stanton,gleyber torres,greg allen,harrison bader,isiah kiner-falefa,jake bauers,jamie wilkes,josh donaldson,journalism,juan carela,keynan middleton,kyle higashioka,new york yankees,oswald peraza,oswaldo cabrera,reds,review,reviews,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,the bronx,twilight dawning,twilightdawning,twilightdawning.com,wilkes-barre,yankee stadium,yankees|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in July – Part Two – The Pitchers\\xa0(2023)Posted onAugust 4, 2023bytwilightdawningReplySo, continuing on with this theme of the Yankees appalling collapse in July – It is not appalling because the Yankees have a divine right to success. It’s is appalling because the Yankees’ roster is not the roster of the Kansas City Royals, or the Oakland Athletics. It is appalling because going into the season, it appeared that the Yankees had a roster which was the envy of everyone, and had a starting rotation which looked like one of the best, if not the best in the Majors.Gerrit Cole–Carlos Rodon–Nestor Cortes–Luis Severino–Frankie Montas— and if injuries aroseDomingo GermanandClarke Schmidtto fall back on.Injuries came – and too many. Even then the bullpen held up the weight, but by July the relievers were over-tired, and withAaron Judgeinjured the team was going nowhere but down.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|Taggedaaron boone,aaron judge,albert abreu,analysis,athletics,baseball,brian cashman,bronx,bronx bombers,carlos rodon,clarke schmidt,clay holmes,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,deivi garcia,domestic violence,domingo german,frankie montas,gerrit cole,ian hamilton,isiah kiner-falefa,jhony brito,jimmy cordero,jimmy cordero - suspension,josh donaldson,journalism,kansas city,kansas city royals,luis severino,matt krook,michael king,mlb - domestic violence policy,nestor cortes,new york yankees,nick ramirez,oakland,oakland athletics,railriders,randy vasquez,review,reviews,ron marinaccio,royals,rule 5 draft,scranton,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,the bronx,tommy kahnle,wandy peralta,wilkes-barre,yankees|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in July – Part One – The Batters\\xa0(2023)Posted onAugust 3, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyThe Yankees needed to see a massive improvement in their performance in July, Instead, they went 10-15 on the month.The Yankees wanted to narrow the gap on the teams ahead of them in the wild card race. Instead, they slipped out of contention and finished the month in fifth place in the American League East.The logic had been that psychologically the Yankees were struggling without their captain, leader, and best player, Aaron Judge. His time out of the team went on and on and it was the 28th of July before he returned.But the Yankees need to be more than just a one-man club, however significant that absentee was.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|Taggedaaron judge,analysis,anthony rizzo,anthony volpe,baseball,ben rortvedt,billy mckinney,bronx,bronx bombers,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,dj lemahieu,franchy cordero,giancarlo stanton,gleyber torres,greg allen,harrison bader,isiah kiner-falefa,jake bauers,jose trevino,josh donaldson,journalism,kyle higashioka,marlins,miami,miami marlins,new york yankees,oswald peraza,oswaldo cabrera,patriots,review,reviews,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,somerset,somerset patriots,the bronx,wilkes-barre,willie calhoun,yankees|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in June – Part Two – The Pitchers\\xa0(2023)Posted onJuly 5, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyAs we have seen in the analysis of the batters’ statistics the Yankees really over-depended on the pitchers in June, and in particular their bullpen.Obviously, this cannot continue. In a peculiar way, the steady drip, drip, drip, of pitchers returning from injury means that fresh arms are being made available. Some have been out all season (Tommy Kahnle), others for a shorter time (Ian Hamilton). And the return ofCarlos Rodonis not too far away.It seems likely that before the trading deadline, the Yankees will need to bring new offensive and pitching stars. Let’s hope they are able to do so without giving too much away.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|Taggedalbert abreu,analysis,baseball,boston,boston red sox,bronx,bronx bombers,carlos rodon,clarke schmidt,clay holmes,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,david cone,david wells,dodgers,domingo german,don larsen,gerrit cole,giants,gleyber torres,greg weissert,ian hamilton,isiah kiner-falefa,jhony brito,jimmy cordero,journalism,los angeles,los angeles dodgers,luis severino,matt krook,michael king,new york yankees,nick ramirez,perfect game,randy vasquez,rays,red sox,review,reviews,ron marinaccio,ryan weber,san francisco,san francisco giants,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,tampa bay,tampa bay rays,the bronx,tommy kahnle,wandy peralta,yankee stadium,yankees|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in June – Part One – The Batters\\xa0(2023)Posted onJuly 4, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyThe Yankees in the month of June have run 11-12. During that time, they have four new faces added to the injured list.Crucially,Aaron Judgewent in that direction. When he made an amazing fielding play whilst crashing into the wall in front of the bullpen, it seemed both amazing and humorous. Now, it doesn’t seem so funny anymore. Judge is injured, with no timetable for his return. And the form of others has nose-dived as the team in general seem to feeling his absence psychologically.Also newly injured and unavailable areNestor Cortes,Greg AllenandWillie Calhoun.Returning?Ian Hamilton,Harrison Bader,Giancarlo Stanton,Tommy Kahnle, andJosh Donaldson.Ryan Weberwent from the 15 day injured list to the 60 day list.On balance, if it wasn’t for the Judge injury, you’d think that the Yankees’ roster had gained in June, but if you consider that some of the returnees are notorious under-performers in recent times, then it doesn’t look quite that good.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|TaggedAaron Hicks,aaron judge,analysis,anthony rizzo,anthony volpe,baseball,ben rortvedt,billy mckinney,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,dj lemahieu,giancarlo stanton,gleyber torres,greg allen,harrison bader,ian hamilton,isiah kiner-falefa,jake bauers,jose trevino,josh donaldson,journalism,kyle higashioka,nestor cortes,new york yankees,oswaldo cabrera,review,reviews,ryan weber,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,tommy kahnle,willie calhoun,yankees|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in May – Part Two – The Pitchers\\xa0(2023)Posted onJune 7, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyThe Yankees went from one game over .500 to ten games over .500 in the course of the month of May – rising from 15-14 to 34-24.In the process, they moved from 4th in the division to third and remained in close contention for a wild card spot, moving between 2nd and 3rd in that particular race. They were close and back-and-forth with their modern era fierce rivals, the Houston Astros.None of this could hide the reality of just how far they are behind the Tampa Bay Rays, who were quickest out of the traps and have not slowed to any considerable extent.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|Taggedalbert abreu,analysis,astros,baseball,bronx,clarke schmidt,clay holmes,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,deivi garcia,domingo german,frankie montas,gerrit cole,greg weissert,houston,houston astros,ian hamilton,jhony brito,jimmy cordero,journalism,luis severino,michael king,nestor cortes,nestor cortes jr,new york yankees,nick ramirez,railriders,randy vasquez,rays,review,reviews,ron marinaccio,ryan weber,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,statistics,stats,sticky stuff,tampa bay,tampa bay rays,the bronx,wandy peralta,yankees|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in May – Part One – The Batters\\xa0(2023)Posted onJune 5, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyThe Yankees’ injury situation in May began to settle down. Only four players were added to the injured –Aaron Judge,Jose Trevino,Ian HamiltonandOswald Peraza. And whilst it is never going to be easy to lose Judge, in particular, it must be noted that three of these players bounced back at the end of the 10 days that their period on the injured list required. Hamilton will be out for longer.At the same time, many players were heading for rehab assignments and moving closer to a return. These includedLuis Severino,Josh Donaldson,Tommy Kahnle, andBen Rortvedt.Perhaps even more significantly the Yankees finally gave up on the wretched tenure ofAaron Hicks, accepting that clearing a space on the roster was more important than worrying how much of his contract they were still going to be liable for. They designated him for assignment on the 20th of the month – and when he cleared waivers without any notable interest, they released him a week later. Hicks signed for Baltimore by the end of the month.In a parallel move, the Yankees traded with the Boston Red Sox, giving up minor leaguerDiego Hernandezand acquiringGreg Allen. Allen had previously played for the Bronx Bombers in 2020.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|TaggedAaron Hicks,aaron judge,analysis,anthony rizzo,anthony volpe,baltimore,baltimore orioles,baseball,ben rortvedt,boston,boston red sox,bronx,bronx bombers,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,diego hernandez,dj lemahieu,franchy cordero,giancarlo stanton,gleyber torres,greg allen,harrison bader,ian hamilton,isiah kiner-falefa,jake bauers,jose trevino,josh donaldson,journalism,kyle higashioka,luis severino,new york yankees,orioles,oswald peraza,oswaldo cabrera,red sox,review,reviews,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,statistics,stats,the bronx,tommy kahnle,willie calhoun|Leave a replyWhat\\xa0air’s\\xa0from\\xa0home.\\xa0Haply\\xa0this\\xa0life\\xa0is\\xa0bestPosted onMay 19, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyWhat: Cymbeline by William ShakespeareWhere: The Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon (RST)When: 22nd April-27 May, 2023Who: The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC)An excellent production!!But that does need some explanation and clarification.What do we have here?Continue reading→Posted inlive show,Overview,Review,Theatre,William Shakespeare|Taggedadam baker,alexandra gilbreath,amber james,analysis,arviragus,barnaby tobias,belarius,braveheart,brian blessed,britain,caius lucius,cat white,christian patterson,cloten,conor glean,cornelius,cymbeline,daf thomas,darren hirst,dorothy,dutchman,ed sayer,Fear no more the heat of the sun...,first lord,frenchman,greg doran,Gregory Doran,guiderius,helen,iachimo,imogen,iwan bond,jake mann,jamie wilkes,jeff alexander,Julius Caesar,keith osborn,marcia lecky,mark hadfield,mel gibson,mel gibson braveheart,milford haven,miranda,morgan,mother,peter de jersey,philario,pisanio,polydore,posthumous,posthumous leonatus,review,reviews,rome,royal shakespeare company,royal shakespeare theatre,rsc,rst,second lord,shakespeare,sicilius,soothsayer,spaniard,stephen brimson lewis,stratford-upon-avon,the comedy of errors,the queen,the tempest,theo ogundipe,tom chapman,twilight dawning,twilightdawning.com,wales,william shakespeare|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in March and April – Part Two – The Pitchers\\xa0(2023)Posted onMay 10, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyPotentially, from the injured list we gave you at the head of our last article, you could put together four-fifths of a starting rotation, and four relievers to add to your bullpen.The injuries included Carlos Rodon, who was intended to be the number two starter in 2023, Luis Severino a potential number four starter, and Frankie Montas who was originally brought in from Oakland to be a number 5 starter.Leading bullpen pieces who were missing in action included Tommy Kahnle, and Jonathan Loaisiga.There was no question that these were going to be devastating  for the Yankees’ early season chances of success.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|Taggedalbert abreu,analysis,baseball,bronx,carlos rodon,chicago,chicago white sox,clarke schmidt,clay holmes,colten brewer,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,domingo german,frankie montas,gerrit cole,greg weissert,ian hamilton,isiah kiner-falefa,jhony brito,jimmy cordero,jonathan loaisiga,journalism,luis severino,michael king,minnesota,minnesota twins,nasty nestor,nestor cortes,new york yankees,nick ramirez,railriders,review,reviews,ron marinaccio,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,statistics,stats,the bronx,tommy kahnle,twins,wandy peralta,white sox,wilkes-barre,yankees|Leave a replyThe New York Yankees in March and April – Part One – The Batters\\xa0(2023)Posted onMay 8, 2023bytwilightdawningReplyHere we go… Harrison Bader, Lou Trivino, Tommy Kahnle, Carlos Rodon, Luis Gil, Frankie Montas, Scott Effross, Luis Severino, Ben Rortvedt, Jonathan Loaisiga, Giancarlo Stanton, and Josh Donaldson.This is the shortlist of players that the Yankees had to place on the injured list through March and April in 2023. It is fair to say it left them with a much weakened team.That they managed to come through to the end of April with a record of 15-14 was no mean achievement. But a 3 game losing streak against the Texas Rangers at the close of the month meant that they were 4th in the division table, albeit that the American League East is by the far the strongest of the divisions.Continue reading→Posted inbaseball,general update,Overview,Review,sport|Taggedaaron judge,analysis,anthony rizzo,anthony volpe,baseball,ben rortvedt,carlos rodon,darren hirst,darrenhirst.com,dj lemahieu,estevan florial,franchy cordero,frankie montas,giancarlo stanton,gleyber torres,harrison bader,isiah kiner-falefa,jake bauers,jonathan loaisiga,jose trevino,josh donaldson,journalism,lou trivino,luis gil,luis severino,new york yankees,oswaldo cabrera,railriders,rangers,review,reviews,scott effross,scranton,scranton / wilkes-barre,scranton/wilkes-barre railriders,sport,texas,texas rangers,tommy kahnle,twilight dawning,twilightdawning.com,willie calhoun|Leave a replyPost navigation←Older postsBlog at WordPress.com.twilightdawningBlog at WordPress.com.FollowFollowingtwilightdawningJoin 52 other followersSign me upAlready have a WordPress.com account?Log in now.twilightdawningCustomizeFollowFollowingSign upLog inReport this contentView site in ReaderManage subscriptionsCollapse this barLoading Comments...Write a Comment...Email (Required)Name (Required)Website - twilightdawning | a writer's thoughts â€“ mainly about music, sport and theatre. shakespeare, bob dylan, live shows, new york yankees\\t a writer's thoughts - mainly about music, sport and theatre. shakespeare, bob dylan, live shows, new york yankees\",\n",

       " 'onlyballingame.comSkip to contentPrimary MenuKeluaran HkData Sgponlyballingame.comWhat Is a Slot?Posted onSeptember 19, 2023byadminonlyballinA slot is a thin opening or groove in something. It is used to pass objects through, such as letters and postcards in a post office mail slot. Online casinos use slots to allow players to play their games on mobile devices. They typically offer the same payout percentage, RTP score, jackpot amounts, and other game features as desktop versions of the same games. Some sites even offer free spins as part of their welcome bonus offers or VIP club memberships.Before you start playing, decide how much you’re comfortable spending on a single session of slots. Then, select a machine that fits your budget. Many players prefer to stick with classic three-reel slot machines that feature fewer paylines and a lower risk of losing money. Five-reel slot games, on the other hand, offer more complex gameplay and a higher chance of winning larger sums of money.One of the most important things to keep in mind when playing penny slots is that you should only bet what you can afford to lose. This rule applies whether you’re at a physical casino or an online casino. You should also avoid making impulsive decisions while on the casino floor. If you’ve been losing for a while, it may be time to walk away from the game and try again another day.It’s also crucial to read all available information before you play a slot machine. Make sure you understand the rules, payout limits, and jackpot prizes. You should also check the max cashout amount, which can help you avoid any unpleasant surprises when you’re ready to withdraw your winnings.The maximum cashout limit for slot depends on the casino. Some casinos will display the maximum cashout limit on the help screen, while others will list it in the terms and conditions. The maximum cashout limit for slot games can be very high, which is why it’s essential to know what it is before you begin playing.In general, a slot is a gaming device that accepts paper tickets with barcodes or cash as payment and then displays a series of reels. When the reels stop spinning, winning combinations earn credits based on the pay table displayed above the slot machine’s reels. Some slot machines have special symbols, such as Wilds and Scatters, which substitute for other symbols to form winning combinations. Most slot games have a theme, and the symbols and bonus features usually align with this theme. Some machines also have a progressive jackpot, which increases with each spin until a player wins the prize. A progressive jackpot can be life-changing for a lucky player!Posted inNewsHow to Find a Good SportsbookPosted onSeptember 18, 2023byadminonlyballinA sportsbook is a place where gamblers can make bets on different events. They usually have clearly labeled odds that show how much a particular team is favored to win. They can also choose to bet on underdogs if they want to take a risky bet and try to win big. The best way to find a good sportsbook is by checking out reviews of different ones. Some of them are even available online.When you’re looking for a sportsbook, it’s important to find one that’s reliable and offers a user-friendly interface. If your sportsbook crashes often or the odds are always off, users will be quickly frustrated and may move on to another site.To ensure your sportsbook is working as it should, you need to keep an eye on everything from your software platform to your back-end infrastructure. It’s also essential to have the right team in place so that you can address any issues immediately.Developing a sportsbook from scratch is an expensive proposition. It requires a significant amount of time and effort to create all the components, including integrations with data providers, odds providers, payment gateways, KYC verification suppliers, risk management systems, etc. If you’re not an expert in building a sportsbook from the ground up, you should consider using a turnkey or white-label solution. This can save you a lot of time and money, but it comes with some downsides.If you decide to go with a turnkey or white-label option, you’ll be paying for the service even when you don’t have bets to process. This can make your margins razor thin and leave you shelling out more than you’re bringing in some months. This is why many experienced operators prefer to run their own sportsbooks rather than outsourcing this service to a third party.Another mistake that many sportsbooks make is not providing their users with tips and advice on how to play the game well. Adding value-added services like this can help to drive engagement and boost customer retention. It’s also a great way to get people to recommend your product to their friends and family.Lastly, a sportsbook needs to have a solid mobile app to offer a good user experience. A mobile app should be fast, responsive, and easy to use on any device. It should also be easy to navigate and feature a clean design. It should also support all major payment methods so that players can deposit and withdraw their funds without any issues. Moreover, the app should be scalable so that it can easily scale as your user base grows.Posted inNewsHow to Find a Casino OnlinePosted onSeptember 17, 2023byadminonlyballinOnline casino games are a great way to enjoy your favorite casino games without leaving the comfort of home. Whether you want to play blackjack, roulette or baccarat, there are many options available. Some casinos even offer live dealer gaming, which allows players to interact with dealers in real time. These games can be played on a desktop computer or mobile device. The best online casinos have a good reputation for fairness and reliability, and they usually pay winnings quickly. Many also have a generous welcome bonus and other promotions.Before you start playing at an online casino, make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully. You should know how much money you can win, the minimum and maximum wagering amounts, and any additional restrictions. You should also check the payment methods offered and the transaction fees. In addition, it is important to understand how the casino protects your personal information. Ensure that the website uses data encryption and SSL security.To find a casino online that suits your preferences, you should first create a short list of websites to visit and inspect. This will help you avoid registering at a site that does not meet your needs. You should also consider the types of games that the casino offers and the bonuses it offers. You should also read the privacy policy to see how the site collects and uses your information.When selecting an online casino, it is essential to look for a site that is licensed and regulated by a reputable authority. This will ensure that the casino follows strict standards and is subject to regular audits by third-party organizations. It is also a good idea to check out player reviews and industry recommendations. Lastly, you should also ensure that the casino accepts your preferred payment method.The best payout online casinos provide a strong overall user experience, with slick software, great bonuses and lenient wagering requirements. They also have a variety of high-quality games and excellent customer service. Some of them are linked to land-based casinos and offer loyalty programs that can earn you free bet credits.There are a number of different ways to fund your account at an online casino, including credit cards, e-wallets, and digital currencies. Before you deposit any money, check that the casino accepts your preferred payment method and that it has a secure encrypted connection. Then, you can play your favorite casino games and cash out your winnings when it’s time to do so.There are hundreds of different casino games to choose from, including progressive jackpots and Megaways titles. Popular table games include roulette, blackjack and baccarat, as well as poker and bingo. Some casinos even offer unique or localized versions of these games. You can also check the licensing and ownership details of a casino, as well as its reputation. If it has a lot of unresolved complaints or is not recommended by industry experts, you should steer clear of it.Posted inNewsHow to Play PokerPosted onSeptember 16, 2023byadminonlyballinPoker is a card game that requires skill to play well. It’s also a game of chance, but the best players are able to control the game by knowing when to raise and when to fold. They also know which hands are good and which ones to play and not play. It’s these skills that make them better than the rest.Before the game starts, each player buys in for a certain amount of chips. These chips represent money, and are generally of the same color (white for the lowest value, red for highest). Each player is then dealt two cards. Once everyone has their chips, they begin betting in intervals. Each player must either “call” the bet of the player before them by putting in at least as many chips into the pot as that player, or they can raise it. If they raise it, the player to their left must either call or raise again.After the players have all made their bets, they reveal their cards and the player with the best hand wins the pot. This is called the showdown. If there is a tie, the dealer wins the pot. The game can be played with up to 10 players. With more than 10, you should divide into two groups and organize a separate game for each group.While it’s not always easy to tell what someone is holding in poker, especially when you first start playing, it becomes much easier with practice. As you become more familiar with the rules of the game and how to play it, your intuition will grow stronger and you’ll find that you keep a natural count of frequencies and EV estimations in your head during hands.You’ll find that the most important thing to remember when learning how to play poker is table position. This is because your position will affect how much you can bluff and what kind of bets you can make. It’s important to realize that you should never make a bet in the early positions to the left of the button, as this could cost you the game.If you don’t have a strong enough hand, it’s best to fold. This will save you money and help you avoid losing too much of your chips to weak hands. However, if you have a good kicker, it’s worth trying to make your hand.If you’re unsure about how to play poker, it’s helpful to read some books on the subject. These books will teach you the rules of the game, and will give you tips on how to improve your skills. They’ll also help you learn more about different strategies and how to win at poker. Once you’ve learned the basics of poker, you can start experimenting with different strategies and tactics to see what works for you! Just be sure to practice your poker skills often, and you’ll be winning big in no time!Posted inNewsIncrease Your Chances of Winning the Lottery by Investing in Low-Cost Stocks and Mutual FundsPosted onSeptember 15, 2023byadminonlyballinA lottery is a game of chance in which people pay for tickets for a small chance of winning a prize, sometimes in the millions. Lotteries are often run by state and federal governments. In some countries, people can even win cash prizes without ever purchasing a ticket.The idea of winning the lottery seems like a fantasy for many people, but there are ways to improve your chances of winning. You can try buying more tickets, avoiding numbers that are associated with birthdays or other significant dates, and selecting random lottery numbers rather than sequences (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5-6).If you’re not interested in playing the lottery, you can still increase your odds of winning by investing in low-cost stocks or mutual funds. These investments could yield high returns over time, but it is important to research each investment before making a purchase. You can also use a lottery annuity to increase your winnings.Regardless of how you choose to invest your money, it’s important to consider the tax implications when choosing a lottery annuity. A lump-sum payment may seem appealing, but it comes with a high tax rate. On the other hand, a structured settlement or annuity can reduce your taxes and offer you a steady stream of payments over time.Lottery commissions advertise that playing is fun and the experience of scratching a ticket is satisfying, but these messages obscure the regressivity of the industry. In fact, the poor spend a disproportionate amount of their discretionary incomes on lottery tickets. The bottom quintile of US households spends about 20% of their income on them, a percentage far higher than those in the 21st through 60th percentile.Another issue is that lottery sales are heavily subsidized by taxpayer dollars. Lottery revenues make up a large share of state budgets, but it’s hard to justify their expense in the face of declining public funding and growing deficits.To keep ticket sales robust, states have to pay out a respectable proportion of prize money. This, in turn, cuts into the amount of revenue available for programs like education. The problem is that consumers don’t recognize that lottery proceeds are a form of implicit taxation.Americans spend over $80 Billion on lotteries a year. That’s more than $600 per household. While winning the lottery is a dream of many, it’s better to save that money and put it towards an emergency fund or paying off credit card debt. If you are going to spend that money on a lottery, be sure to consult with a trusted financial advisor to determine how best to utilize the funds.

kevinegperryFleeting ImagesCowboys and Horse Girls. Happy 60th Birthday Debbie! Barn life in Ballard. Divine seafood at Bar Le Côte. Wine with Wes (learned something about tannins). The steak at Bell\\'s. The mackerel. More wine. More horsin\\' around. A gorgeous, gluttonous weekend celebrating the wonderful @lindsayunwin and @emtoshack 🐴There\\'s an important cultural difference between the Santa Ynez Valley and California\\'s more well-known wine country to the north. “In Sonoma, you have farm country,” says Daisy Ryan, executive chef and co-owner of Michelin-starred foodie destination Bell’s in Los Alamos. “Down here, it’s ranch country. That history runs deep.” We spent a glorious couple of days exploring recently, including a visit to Zaca Creek Ranch to see their cattle, goats and most importantly llamas and alpacas (1). Other than that we mostly ate like Old West tycoons. At our new favourite Bell\\'s (2) we gorged on locally-caught Santa Barbara uni with caviar atop a soft and light French omelette (3) and decadent Gateau Breton (4). At Bar Le Côte I loved the soft shell crab served with shaved cabbage and plum preserves (5). You could taste the care in the home-smoked pastrami Reuben at the delightful, family-run Peasants Feast (6). A brief respite from the food to tour vineyards and drink fine wines with Sonja Magdevski (7). Pork belly that melts like butter, served with clams, and sizeable scallops with corn miso and English peas at Mattei\\'s Tavern (8). After all that it was enough to float in the hotel\\'s serene outdoor pool (9), day-dreaming about how stagecoaches were posting up here as far back as 1886 (10). If this is ranch life, I think I could get used to it. Full story in today\\'s @the.independent\"It\\'s like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don\\'t concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.\"Paris Texas are just about ready to get off this planet. On ‘Mid Air’, the LA punk-rap duo’s thrill-packed debut album, they trade bars about escaping this doomed rock by saving up enough cash for a one way ticket to Mars. “The sun is whoopin’ everybody’s ass,” they lament. “Earth finally threw in the towel.”A Song By Matt FarleyCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.WPExplorer.FollowFollowingThe Collected Works of Kevin EG PerryJoin 93 other followersSign me upAlready have a WordPress.com account?Log in now.The Collected Works of Kevin EG PerryCustomizeFollowFollowingSign upLog inReport this contentView site in ReaderManage subscriptionsCollapse this bar - the collected works of kevin eg perry | articles for the independent, nme, vice, the guardian, gq et al. articles for the independent, nme, vice, the guardian, gq et al.',\n",

       " '\" Welcome to Lavender Dreams \"skip to main|skip to sidebar\" Welcome to Lavender Dreams \"Friday, September 15, 2023Horses and Cows and Bees....OH MY!I always see a lot of birds when I go to the Halpata Tastanaki Preserve but I also see some other interesting sights.When you drive into the Pruitt Trailhead from hwy 484, the road goes through the preserve to the Florida Trails and HTP trailhead but it also has some private land to the West.I love seeing the horses on this horse farm.They look so peaceful in this setting and the sky was darkening with a shower coming in from the Gulf.There are also cows grazing....or cows gazing!So those were some of the sights I saw when I started my hike.What did I see when I ended the hike?A swarm of honey bees.I\\'ve never seen that on a hike but when I went back a week later they were still there.The bees are right in the center of this photo.I know they may not be dangerous but I gave them a wide berth and zoomed in for these photos.They were quite active! Hope the scout finds them a hollow tree or good place for their hive. I guess I\\'ll check on them again in a few days!So what\\'s buzzin\\'....or mooing where you live?Have you had a good week too?I’m joining Saturday’s crittersHEREand Mosaic MondayHERE!Posted by~Lavender Dreamer~at8:11\\u202fAM40 comments:Labels:Cows,Halpata Tastanaki Preserve,Hike,Honey bee,Horse Farm,Horses,Pruitt,WalkFriday, September 8, 2023Learning to identify birds!It\\'s not easy to identify the birds we see! There are so many things to take into consideration when you see a bird that is not readily recognized. We see a lot of birds here in Florida and take a lot of photos.I think it\\'s great fun to come home and get the photos on the computer and start zooming in on them to see if we can figure out what we\\'ve seen. There are definitely some \\'fly bys\\' that we are never sure of.TheSibley Guide to Birdsis the best book in my opinion.We have a lot of books specifically for Florida but so many of the birds we see are migratory and not year round regulars.So here are a few that we identified this week on a trip to Halpata Tastanaki Preserve, hiking from the Pruitt Trailhead.I think this is the most beautiful bobwhite I\\'ve ever seen. The plumage was so colorful.Florida BobwhiteAnd here\\'s the ID page in Sibley\\'s....Another beautiful bird perched in a tree!A close up of the Florida bobwhite....Sometimes birds are quite a distance away or high in a tree.Common Ground DoveThe ID page in Sibley\\'s....And this one was a little trickier. We have seen the Blue Grosbeak in this area all summer but this one wasn\\'t blue!Blue Grosbeak (1st Winter)The page in Sibleys....It\\'s always fun to get out in nature and learn more about the birds you see.Do you enjoy ID books too and learning something new?And other books you would recommend?I’m joining Saturday’s crittersHEREand Mosaic MondayHERE!Posted by~Lavender Dreamer~at8:11\\u202fAM40 comments:Labels:Blue Grosbeak,Bobwhite,Common Ground-Dove,Florida,Florida bobwhite,Halpata Tastanaki Preserve,Hike,ID books,Pruitt,WalkFriday, September 1, 2023A Quick trip to the Pruitt Trailhead!Even a short hike can reap great results!When we drove in, the first bird I saw was perched on an old dead snag. So I rolled the window down and took a photo.Mississippi KiteWe see Kites all through the summer months here in Florida.Swallow-tailed KiteQueen ButterflyThe stars of this little outing were the butterflies!The Queen butterfly was exquisite!And some of them were a duller brownish color.The Gulf Fritillary is always a pretty orange and common in North Central Florida.And here are the maps for this little outing!I love these unknown roads! I feel right at home here!Happy September everyone!I am getting this post done early before Hurricane Idalia comes through. I\\'ll update it to let everyone know how we fared. Hopefully it will just be a rain event for our area and we won\\'t have any damage. I\\'m keeping everyone in the path of the storm in my prayers.Update : We weathered the storm without any damage. You don\\'t have to drive far to see a lot of damage though. We live about 30 miles, as the crow flies from Cedar Key. But we are fine and have clear skies and hot temps again!

I was surprised when we drove down this road that it was listed as an unknown road!Perfect! I love it!Let\\'s see where it leads!Oh, it leads to the Gulf of Mexico!Well you can\\'t go wrong with a trip down an unknown dirt road to the coast.And it was beautiful when we got there. The parking lot was empty on a Saturday morning, which surprised us.We took a little hike down the Withlacoochee Bay trail.What will we see today?Wasn\\'t this Great White Egret gorgeous!Hubby got a new Chevy \\'pick em up\\' truck .And he even let me drive it....through a mud puddle!We stopped at the locks on the way home and saw a rain shower in the distance.It sure was a fun day (and yes, we got rained on)! Thanks hubby for the beautiful Great White Egret photos and for letting me get your new truck dirty!Do you like to take a drive?

It\\'s August.It\\'s Florida!But let\\'s tie the jeep to the hitching post at the 49th Ave trailhead and get out on the trails.I chose a morning after a rain and the woods were still dripping wet and it felt cooler.Or less hot!And I saw all kinds of pretty birds.Isn\\'t this Blue-gray Gnatcatcher beautiful?And I think this was a young one flying alongside the parent.I was pleased to get them both in the photo.I saw lots of wildflowers and some deer grazing.Look at that tongue! He was eating something tasty!A Black-and-white Warbler, Zebra Swallowtail and a Flicker.A nice day to get out early and enjoy the beauty of nature.And it will cool off one day soon.

Formula for ₹7,418.48. I started meditation from Biogetica since January last year and am very happy with the results. I do not experience any side effects after consuming your medications as compared to Allopathic Medications. . I believe that Biogetica products are ailment-specific 100% All Natural medicines. I am very grateful to you for the same. There is just one problem, Cerevitan capsule which is the most important medicine for me is constantly delayed as it is out of stock and this time it\\'s delayed by more than 2 months. I request you to kindly look into the matter and do something about the above. Your medications have helped me to a great extent, specially Cerevitan capsule and I appreciate if you could ensure the stock of this capsule.\\nThanking you in anticipation of your immediate action in this regard.Penelope Nigrel“I would like to testify that Biogetica natural health products are truly effective.

I love your combinations, especially the following kits:Hepatitis Prostate hypertrophy High blood pressure Syphilis Psoriasis.May God richly bless the brains behind this wonderful company. I wish you good luck and success.”about Biogetica ProductsDr.O.Y.“WOW WOW WOW! How can a product work this good and not be prescribed by dermatologists everywhere? Why isn\\'t it on the news or in stores? My best friend asked me if I had cosmetic surgery on my face because she said I looked 10 years younger. Just from one month using your Skinelle Acne line and my cystic pimples are nearly all gone. The few that have appeared don\\'t linger for the usual weeks on end but disappear with in a couple of days. And to my surprise, my skin is glowing! I wish everyone who is suffering from one ailment or another could stumble upon your web site as I have. I wish I could scream it from a mountain top! I will be writing to Oprah about your company. I hope she talks about it on her show as it will mean it is being screamed from a mountain top. Thank you so much!”about Biogetica ProductsJ.D“Thank you Biogetica for your help. I have used your products for hpv, candida and eczema with very good results. After 4 months of using your hpv kit, I just got my pap and hpv results yesterday and I\\'m all clear! No hpv and a normal pap! Thank you! I have been using your eczema kit for a month and am already seeing results, the eczema on my upper arms is gone and the patches on my neck are fading. I have also been on your candida remedy for a month and am seeing very good progress. I look forward to continuing these remedies and getting better and better. Your doctors are always so kind and helpful when I have questions. Biogetica remedies work and it is a very caring, compassionate company.\\nThank you!”A.C“You guys have cured me of TWO \"incurable\" diseases. This is why I spend hundreds of dollars curing my friends of them as well. No amount of money can pay for the smiles on peoples faces. Stay in the fight guys. You are winning :)”J.S“Thank you for your speedy response! Yesterday, my mother informed me that the vertigo \"medicine\" is working marvelously.\\nShe has been using it for five months now and has had veritably no symptomatic recurrences at all. Understandably, she calls your products \"miraculous\".\\nKeep up the good work!”Dr.M.G.“My wife has had warts on her hands for about 6 years now. She started using the freedom kit, and within 4 days could see visible shrinking of the warts. It has been a month now, and her warts just vanished as if it was never there. We only wish we had known about this remedy earlier.”C.P“I found your website while looking for solutions to support the liver. What I found is much more than Liver Support, what a website! It\\'s fantastic, the information is invaluable. I saw the Resource tab and have been doing the guided meditation for several nights now, so relaxing, but especially, the guided meditation that houses the full community or universe of beings. After reading all of the material, especially with regard to homeopathy, I am impressed. This is a fully functional website with information to support each and every one of your clients. Most websites are interested primarily in selling, Biogetica is providing lifelong tools. My compliments to Biogetica.”C.B“I do not find the correct words to express the grateful feelings my heart feels. You really are my friends. I feel fine, the trigeminal pain is gone and I am so grateful for your wonderful medications.”J.H“My mother has had Idio Pathic Pulmoary Fibrosis for 7 years and now has Emphysema to boot. I thank you so VERY much for your herbs which have been wonderful in their affects. Acupuncture, on top of that has helped dramatically after the Drs said there was nothing more that could be done!!!! God Bless!!!”M.P“I finished my bottle of HPRZ and I just had my PAP test 2 weeks ago and the results are back...It came out great and all the precancerous cells are gone too! It was my fourth test and the Doctor felt sure that it wasn\\'t going to be better and I would need surgery. I can\\'t thank you enough and I will recommend you in the future to anyone who has a similar problem.”B.VSCIENTIFICEVIDENCEHerpesGroundbreaking Herpes Trial with Hyperisince where 76% of patients benefitted with results 3x quicker than Acyclovir.

Every thought, every emotion leads to a series of chemical changes in the body. Every molecule exists by virtue of its vibration. Ailments, then, are a result of disharmony in our life force. We, at Biogetica, seek to restore balance in the ENTIRE BEING, across the physical, energetic and informational spectrum of consciousness.** Treating an ailment on the molecular level alone, as is often seen in Western medicine, seldom has a lasting effect, as the untreated social, emotional, mental, spiritual and energetic patterns cause the ailment to manifest once again on the physical plane. Holistic healing is therefore necessary for lasting relief.

Dispensation of justice is not only an onerous duty but has been considered as akin to discharge of a pious duty, and therefore, is a very serious matter. The standards of probity, conduct, integrity that may be relevant for discharge of duties by a careerist in another job cannot be the same for a judicial officer. A judge holds the office of a public trust. Impeccable integrity, unimpeachable independence with moral values embodied to the core are absolute imperatives which brooks no compromise. A judge is the pillar of the entire justice system and the public has a right to demand virtually irreproachable conduct from anyone performing a judicial function. Judges must strive for the highest standards of integrity in both their professional and personal lives.A daughter has no right u/s 14 of Hindu Succession Act of her father’s property if it is occupied by her brother through adverse possession (SC-28/08/2023)-A Hindu daughter has no right u/s 14 of Hindu Succession Act on the property of her father if it is occupied by her brother through adverse possession (SC-28/08/2023)- [See Pritam Singh v.

       " \"The Wise Sloth | Uncensored advice on lifeHomeTable of ContentsContact/DonateThe Wise SlothUncensored advice on lifeSeptember 2, 2022Why I’m Against Forgiving Student\\xa0LoansBywise slothThe Biden Administration is forgiving up to $10,000 of student loans for people who make up to $125,000. Anyone getting free debt relief is obviously excited about this, and even some people who don’t have any college debt are happy to help.The right wing media is furious though. Social media is flooded with posts pointing out how everyone else deserves a break too, poor people need more help than anyone making $125,000 per year, and it’s unfair to treat people who willingly took on loans as victims. As is always the case in American media, everyone is talking about the wrong things, which is distracting from the real issues and therefore enabling them, guarantying the problem will continue.Everyone knows the price of college tuition skyrockets every year for no other reason than colleges can get away with extorting their customers. One of the main reasons they get away with this is they know it doesn’t matter if their students can afford tuition. As long as students can get a loan, the school will get their money, and whatever happens after that isn’t the their problem.Imagine if the government came out and said, “We realize you need a car to get to work, and the price of cars has risen 1,000% in your lifetime. So we’re going to give everyone who currently has a car loan $1,000. You’re welcome.” Anyone with a car note would say, “Sure, I guess. Thanks for barely nothing.” Anyone without a loan would say, “Fuck you too.” They would both be right, but arguing about the details misses the point. The real issue is the extortionate increase in the price of cars. If the government simply stopped car companies from being able to overcharge their customers, they could fix the problem for free.The second half of the real problem is the interest rates on student loans. Imagine if you bought a car for $10,000 because you needed it to get to work. Then you paid $100 every month for a year, and at the end of the year your loan balance was $10,000. Then the president of the United States comes out and says, “Don’t worry. I’ll save you by making tax payers give your predatory lender $100!”An actual person’s student loan balanceMillennials wouldn’t becrippled by a lifetime of student loan debtif the interest rate was zero, and since student loans are the only debt that can’t be eliminated by filing for bankruptcy, I believe that would be a fair trade.Anyone who is pissed off that it’s unfair for college debtors to get free relief shouldn’t be focusing their arguments on that one myopic point. They should be pointing out that the government could give students more helpfor freeby simply eliminating interest rates, or at least cutting them in half. The only people who lose in that scenario are the ultra rich assholes who created the problem.If we’re going to scream about how something is unfair, we should be screaming about the fact that the government’s only solution to students being exploited by financial institutions is to give huge lump sums of free tax payer money to the exact same bankers who created the problem to begin with. This is exactly how the government dealt with the2008 housing market crash:Step 1: Financial institutions bankrupt consumers by overcharging them. Step 2: Consumers can’t pay off their loans, which means the banks become in danger of going bankrupt. Step 3: The government gives the banks free tax payer money. Step 4: The CEOs of those companies buy mansions, yachts, cocaine, and hookers with that money. Step 5: The consumer never stops living paycheck to paycheck.So, yes, I’m completely against giving those vultures more money. I want students to have debt relief, but I want them to get it at no cost to the tax payer by simply preventing colleges and lending institutions from gouging their customers.If you liked this post, you may like these:Fixing the EconomyMy 1-point plan on how to save the worldHow to reduce America’s federal deficitHumanity’s quality of life is relative to the quality of business model we usePolitics won’t stop being evil until economics stops being evilCollapse is the product of unsustainability.

After a series ofhacks and leaks, the FBI and the State Department investigated her unsecure server.They identified hundreds of E-mails containing classified information, and it’s fair to say they would have found more if Hillary hadn’t hastily deleted 33,000 E-mails. Every agency that investigated her agreed she was “careless” and “negligent” in handling classified information but refused to bring charges against her.When Hillary ran for president in 2016, her opponent, Donald Trump, relentlessly reminded voters about the controversy and encouraged his fans to chant, “Lock her up. Lock her up.” The E-mail scandal played a significant role in Trump defeating Hillary in the 2016 election to become the 45th president of the United States.After leaving office in 2020, Trump took hundreds of classified documents home with him from the White House.In 2021, The National Archives and Records Administration noticed they didn’t have certain items from Trump’s tenure that they’d expected. So they requested he turn over any classified he may have kept. Trump’s lawyers sent back 15 boxes and promised he didn’t have anything else. However, the FBI found evidence that Trump was still in possession of more. So they sent agents to search his home, where they found 26 additional boxes of confidential, secret, and top secret documents.Now history is repeating itself. Government agencies are debating whether Trump’s actions were deliberate, if they warrant prosecution, and if criminal charges are even possible due to their unprecedented nature. The right wing media is saying this is a witch hunt and making every excuse imaginable to defend Trump while the left wing media is acting like all we can do is wait and see what the lawyers decide. They’ve all missed the point… again.My perspective comes from the fact that I served in the U.S. Air Force from 2000 to 2007, and I had a top secret security clearance. Anyone who has worked in a top secret environment can tell you that the vast majority of classified information is boring. Even the culture in a top secret environment is dull by design. You’re not supposed to have fun, or be creative or expressive. When you walk into a secure area, everything is as serious as a heart attack.My first supervisor explained it to me like this, “When something is marked ‘top secret,’ it doesn’t matter how mundane the actual information is. You treat it as if it contains the exact time and location where the president is going to be, and any unauthorized person who sees it is an assassin who will use that info to murder the president. It doesn’t matter if the information fell into the wrong hands because you were negligent or malevolent. Your actions killed the president. That’s all that matters. You see, ‘top secret’ doesn’t just mean ‘really important.’ It means, ‘no mistakes, no excuses, no mercy.'”I recently saw a Tweet that summed it up another way. It said, “Top secret info is like child porn. If it’s in your house, you’re going to jail.”For enlisted personnel, there’s no gray area when it comes to handling classified information. You either follow the rules to perfection, or you get the book thrown at you. On the off-chance you miraculously don’t go to jail for mishandling sensitive material, at the very least you’ll lose your job and your security clearance and never be able to work anywhere near classified information again.It’s worth noting that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn’t just mishandle information that could compromise a single mission or a military base in the middle of nowhere. They failed to safeguard information related to the highest levels of national security…yoursecurity. If they were anyone else, they would have been arrested the moment the FBI found their unsecured documents. The only debate would have been about how long they’d spend in prison.The only question news pundits should be asking in response to the Hillary/Trump saga is why politicians with the highest responsibility to national security are held to the lowest standard of accountability.Share this:RedditFacebookPinterestPocketTwitterEmailLinkedInTumblrPrintLike this:LikeLoading...1 Comment|\\xa0\\xa0tags:hillary email scandal,mar a lago documents| posted inAmerican Politics,PoliticsJuly 25, 2020Tales From The Wise Sloth: The AK-47\\xa0StoryBywise slothIn 2005 I was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and stationed at Sembach Air Force Base, Germany. The experience was culturally amazing and freezing cold.Halfway through my two-year tour, my supervisor informed me I’d been selected to receive an all expense paid trip to the largest beach in the world. That was his way of telling me I was getting deployed to Ali Al Salem Air Force Base in Kuwait.Part of me was relieved to escape Germany’s endless subzero winter nights, but the other part of me was equally dissatisfied with Kuwait’s perpetual 120 degree sand storms. I guess I’m just a spoiled American like that. In retrospect, both experiences were adventures, but I wouldn’t want to spend the rest of my life in either scenario.I’m confessing these emotions so you’ll understand how euphoric I felt when I was sitting at my desk in Kuwait and got an E-mail informing me that my next duty station would be at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii.I re-read that E-mail 20 times before I believed it was real. Then, I printed out 20 copies and laid one on every person’s desk I worked with to rub it in their faces that God anointed me with orders to paradise.For the next few months in Kuwait, and for the rest of my tour in Germany, I fantasized about my upcoming life in Hawaii. I imagined grass huts, luau festivals, surfing, cocktails served in hollowed out pineapples, and sex on the beach. God, I couldn’t wait!These visions were reinforced when I finally arrived in Hawaii, inprocessed into my new squadron, and learned that I would be given a $1,200 per month housing allowance (in addition to my regular salary) to rent a home.However, reality shattered all those dreams the moment I startedhouse-hunting.While I was still living in Germany, I invited my identical twin brother to come live with me. Then, when I got orders to Hawaii, it went without saying he would follow me there. So I needed to find a two-bedroom apartment. However, in 2006, the only city in Oahu I could find a two-bedroom apartment for $1,200 per month wasWaipahu.When you imagine Hawaii, you probably conjure up all the same heavenly tropes I did. In reality, Oahu is overpopulated and mostly covered in suburban sprawl and traffic jams.When I describe Oahu to people, I say, “Imagine if you cut out New York City and put it on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and declared it to be paradise because it’s on an island where the average temperature is 83 degrees.” This analogy is admittedly over-dramatic, but it’s close enough to the truth to be useful.There are some places on Oahu that can be legitimately considered paradise, but it costs $2000+ per month to live in those gentrified neighborhoods. Waipahu is a straight up ghetto. The whole time I lived there, I never dared to walk down the street after dark because it went without saying that I would get stabbed and robbed.After leaving Hawaii in 2007, every time I’ve encountered people who lived there, when I tell them I lived in Waipahu, they cringe and ask, “Why the HELL did you live THERE?”Well, why does anyone live in any ghetto? Because it’s affordable.The apartment complex I lived in was protected by 8-foot-tall fences and gates that required akey FOBto enter or exit. Plus, there was a guard stationed at the entrance who would ask to see your resident I.D. card during business hours before letting you enter.One night, I drove up to the front gate in my $2000 convertable Miada and was stopped by a 350+ pound, drunk Hawaiian pretending to be a security guard (even though he wasn’t wearing any kind of uniform). He was obviously friends with the gate guard, who was sitting in the guard shack laughing his ass off and obviously drunk as well. Being a scrawny tech nerd at the time, I had to endure the Hawaiian giant’s abuse of power and tell him whatever he wanted to hear while my ex-wife sat in the passenger seat and judged me for being a submissive beta male. That’s just the kind of place Waipahu is. As they say in the islands, “Might makes right.”One lazy Sunday morning, I was sleeping in my king-sized bed with my ex-wife. A few feet away, my twin brother was sleeping off his nightly hang-over in his room. Around 9:30 AM, we were all awakened by the sound of semi-automatic gun fire directly outside our apartment followed by a man screaming, “JOHN! JOHN! YOU FUCKING MOTHER FUCKER! COME OUT HERE, JOHN! I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!”BANG BANG BANGEven though I’d been stationed in a war zone, I’d never seen combat. I also didn’t own a gun. However, I knew enough about these things to know that when bullets start flying, your best survival strategy is to lay down flat on the ground. So, as soon as everyone in my house jumped out of their beds and started running around like chickens with their heads cut off, I used my most authoritarian voice and ordered everyone to hit the deck and stay there.I plastered my face to the carpet and dragged my ex-wife next to me, but my brother ran straight to the window to see what was happening. Despite my vociferous advice, he stood there, fixed to the glass, giving us a play-by-play narrative:“Oh shit! There’s a big, fat, Hawaiian guy out there with a fucking Ak-47! Oh man! He’s going door to door, knocking on them with the but of the gun and asking random people if John lives there. Oh, shit. He’s knocking on Koa’s door. He’s not going to find Johnthere. Uh, now they’re talking. Now they’re shaking hands. Koa’s going back inside and shutting the door. It looks like they’re all good. Now he’s pacing around aimlessly.”BANG BANG BANG.Then  we could all hear Mr. AK-47 shout, “JOHN, WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU!!!!?? I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU, YOU MOTHER FUCKER!!! YOU RAPED MY FUCKING SISTER!!!!”BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANGObviously, someone (possibly) from my apartment complex named John raped this guy’s sister, and he came to murder him at 9:30 AM on a Sunday, but since he didn’t know where John lived, he had to go door to door asking everyone if they wanted to volunteer to be murdered for raping his sister.After the next gun shot, my ex crawled to her side of the bed, grabbed her phone off the night stand, and dialed 911.Her conversation went something like this:“Hello.”“911, what is your emergency?”“There’s a man outside my apartment firing an AK-47 in the air. He keeps shouting that he’s looking for a man named John who raped his sister.”“Can you describe the man?”“He’s large. He’s Hawaiian, and he’s carrying an AK-47.”“Ma’am. I need more details than that.”“I can’t tell you anything more because I’m laying flat on the floor so I won’t get shot by a stray bullet.”“Then how do you know the suspect is Hawaiian or that he has an AK-47?”“Because my husband’s brother is standing at the window looking at him.”“Well, ma’am. That’s just not enough information for me to go on.”“I’m sorry, but I’m not giong to get up and go look at him.”“Ma’am, I can’t help you if you can’t give me a better description of the suspect.”“Uhhh…. can you just send someone to our apartment complex and look for the guy shooting an AK-47?”“Ugh. Iguesswe’ll send someone.”Click.My ex looked at her phone in amazement and said, “I can’t believe that just happened. She literally said, ‘Iguesswe’ll send someone.'”For the next 15 minutes, we waited on our bellies while my brother watched the meth head circle the courtyard and interrogate any tenet who opened their door when he knocked. We were holding our breath hoping he wouldn’t make it to ours when finally two Hawaiian police officers drove up and asked him to surrender. He immediately gave up his gun without resisting and allowed himself to be put in the back of  the squad car.When it was safe, all my neighbors and I came outside and started talking. It turns out the gunfire and shouting had woken up everyone, and we had all called 911.A few minutes later, one of the cops walked up to us and asked who called the police. We all raised our hands, and then he told us, “We need each of you to come to the squad car and look in the window so you can positively I.D. the suspect.”My outspoken Mexican neighbor told him what we were all thinking, “Hell no! I’m not going near him. I don’t want that crazy meth head to know my face so he can come back and shoot me!” The rest of us shook our heads in agreement.The officer retorted condescendingly, “Then how can we know we have the right person?”My neighbor replied, “You found the guy who was walking around with an AK-47, right!? So why do you need anyone to identify him?”The officer scowled and said, “I guess we’ll take him in anyway,” then walked away.Everyone stood there looking confused, hurt, and angry. After that, life went on, and we never heard anything else about the Sunday morning AK-47 avenger or John the rapist. We never found out if either of them ever got the punishment they deserved.It goes without saying, I hope John was brought to justice eventually. Part of me suspects the police officers who arrested Mr. AK-47 just dropped him off at his house without booking him, and given the circumstances, part of me wouldn’t fault them too much. However, we can all agree that shooting an AK-47 in the air in a densely populated urban area is bad. I hope at least they took his rifle away. In addition, I hope he got the drug abuse intervention he needed. I don’t know for a fact he was an addict, but I’m pretty confident you don’t go wandering around an unfamiliar apartment complex at 9:30 AM on a Sunday morning firing an AK-47 indiscriminately into the air unless you have a meth problem.Epilogue:A few years later I left the Air Force and moved back to Texas. I told this story to an old hometown  friend of mine and ended it by asking rhetorically, “Where does someone even get an AK-47 from in the first place!?!? Hahaaaaa! AmIright!?!?”He didn’t laugh at the punchline at all though. He just looked me dead in the eye and said matter-of-factly, “Dude, if you have $300, I know where you can get an AK-47 right now.”ThenI movedto New Zealand.If you liked this story, you may also like these:My Life Stories (in chronological order)What’s it like to be a twin?The eggnog storyThe cow-poline storyThe time I got shotMy ghost storyThe “good porn” storyMy UFO storyHow I became a Christian and then lost my faithMy first massagePiancanvollo’s traveling snailThe time I got HIVThe very gay cabaretAn American Expat Visits the “Occupy Auckland” protest:Part 1,Part 2The time I worked in an apple orchardThe time I worked in a vineyardMy experience with the TSAThis is how we live now: Part 1This is how we live now: Part 2This is how we live now: Part 3What it was like in Houston during Hurricane HarveyThe aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in HoustonAn imagined conversation with my abusive, narcissistic father(Comic)What happened to The Wise Sloth?Share this:RedditFacebookPinterestPocketTwitterEmailLinkedInTumblrPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Leave a comment|\\xa0\\xa0tags:ak-47,funny,life story,true hawaiian story,waipahu,whats it like to live in hawaii| posted inMy life storiesJuly 21, 2020The Only Way To End Racism Is To End\\xa0PovertyBywise slothIn May of 2020,Black Lives Matter/George Floyd protestsswept across America and even spilled over into other countries. The purpose of the protests was to condemn and end systemic racism against African Americans. Activists would probably still be marching in the streets, but a surge in coronavirus cases has forced everyone back into semi-quarantine. However, the issue is still dominating news feeds on social media.This is probably for the best, because the movement hasn’t settled on a specific set of actionable demands how it wants to end systemic racism.A few suggestionshave been floated, but I haven’t seen any strong actions taken to bring them into law.Since the major protests stopped, most of the changes we’ve seen have been superficial and cultural in nature. They may make people feel better, and some of them may be necessary, but they don’t fundamentally change the way America works. For example, dozens ofstatues connected to slavery have been removed from public spaces. A few people have been fired from their jobs because they said, “All lives Matter.”One woman was shotfor saying “All lives matter.” The Washington Red Skins promised tochange the name of their football team, and many companies and government agencies are hiring “diversity trainers” to give seminars to their employees to show that they did something to combat racism.Most of this may sound good on paper, but each step is being fueled as much by the Social Justice Warrior Movement as it is Black Lives Matter. The SJW movement’s philosophy/message is thatall white people are inherently privileged and racist,black people are inherently victims who can’t be racist, and any white person who is offended by being called racist is reacting from a position ofwhite fragility,white privilege, and subconscious racism.Arguably, the end goal of the SJW movement is for white people to apologize and make amends for their inherent degeneracy every day, in every room, in every situation. I predict that if America continues down this path, it will make racism worse for several reasons and will ultimately result in more race riots until we address the true cause of systemic inequality in America.I once met an ex-white supremacist, and I asked him to give me his old recruitment speech because I wanted to understand how those people thought. He hesitated but agreed and then began reciting statistics about crime rates and how minorities take jobs and lower property values, etc., etc. All of his arguments revolved around economics, which makes sense because the primary target of white supremacy recruitment is poor, disenfranchised white people. Basically, he was saying, “‘You’re’ poor and out of luck because minorities took your opportunities.”Ironically, he was making many of the same arguments social justice warriors preach to blacks for why they should hate whites. Poor people hate that they’re poor, and they need a solution. Then someone comes along and says, “All you have to do is hate someone with a different skin color.” That’s a one-point solution to a one-point problem that’s easy for poor people to wrap their head around.His recruitment speech didn’t convince me to become a white supremacist for the same reason social justice warriors’ propaganda shouldn’t convince anyone to become a black supremacist. The fundamental problem with the economy isn’t that other-colored people are taking all the jobs. The problem is that rich people underpay and overcharge poor people.Even if every single white person in America lined up, took 50 lashes from a whip, and promised to hate themselves for the rest of their lives, it wouldn’t put a single piece of bread on a black person’s table. That’s never going to happen anyway. In a best case scenario, you might convince every upper middle class white person who lives in an predominantly white neighborhood that they’re the root of all evil, but that message will never resonate with all the unskilled white laborers who can’t afford to put food on their family’s table.Telling them they’re the enemy is either going to turn them into one or motivate them to check out of the conversation. Furthermore, telling all black people that they’re victims in a perpetual race war will inevitably stoke their anger to the point where some of them will feel the need fight back with violence. This approach can only increase racial tensions from both ends of the spectrum.However, if you ended poverty, then legitimate white supremacists wouldn’t have any talking points left to recruit new members with. Black people wouldn’t feel victimized and alienated, and every other person of color who isn’t represented in the phrase, “Blacks Lives Matter” will have equal access to a meaningful, fulfilling life.Until you end poverty for everyone, all your virtue signaling will ultimately just distract from the true source of racial tension and thus enable it.If you liked this post, you may also like these:Fixing the EconomyMy 1-point plan on how to save the worldHow to reduce America’s federal deficitHumanity’s quality of life is relative to the quality of business model we usePolitics won’t stop being evil until economics stops being evilCollapse is the product of unsustainability.

The first day I arrived on Oahu, I met the woman who would become my first and only ex wife. About a year and a half later, one evening, I was extremely drunk in that overly emotional kind of way where you hang onto your friend’s shoulder shouting, “I love you, bro.” In that state of mind, I slurred to her, “Baby, I’lllll take youze anywhere in the worlddd you wanna go. Just name the place, and I’ll fly you there.”Lucidly, she snapped back, “Okay. I want to go to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand.”Wait. What?“Fuck,” I thought. “That’s not exactly what I meant…. But, oh well. Screw it.” A month later, I’d filed my request for three weeks of leave and booked a guided tour across Asia through a travel agency at Hickam Air Force Base.I’d already spent four years living in Europe, where I would often just drive in a random direction Friday afternoon, stop in a town that looked interesting, and sleep in my car. So I was no amateur when it came to traveling, but I didn’t know anything about Asia. So I decided I should have someone walk me through my first experience.The big day finally came, and we boarded a plane heading West towards “The East.”Even though everyone told me I was crazy for going to Thailand with my committed partner, we flew to Bangkok together anyway, where, despite my best intentions, my story would still involve dozens of lady boys.When we landed, we were met by a tour guide at the airport holding a sign with my last name written on it, just like in the movies, which made me feel like a celebrity. He drove us to a gigantic five star hotel… in the deepest, darkest bowels of Bangkok. Our room was on the 15th floor with an amazing view of the air conditioning units on the building next-door. Everything else about the place was high class beyond the status I was accustomed to.Over the next week, our tour guide drove us around the city to all the biggest tourist traps. We visited a 5-story flea market with more exotic, shiny knick knacks than you could fill a thousand shipping containers with. We paid monks to see a golden Buddha statue worth enough money to end poverty, and then we fed a ravenous horde of catfish from a shaky skiff on a greasy river. It was all very exotic, opulent, and tinged with signs of poverty.As our guide shuttled us around the city, we bombarded him with every question imaginable about Thailand’s history, current events, and all things sociological, political, economic, and anthropological. I could tell he genuinely enjoyed the fact that we wanted to know all of Thailand’s deepest truths, and I felt like we bonded over that.Everyday, when we took the elevator down from our hotel room to meet our guide, we’d walk past a giant marquee sign in the hotel lobby that read, “Cabaret” in big Broadway light bulbs. Underneath the sign was a 15-foot-wide set of stairs leading down to a basement auditorium.We couldn’tnotbe intrigued. So one day, we asked the front desk clerk how much the cabaret show cost, and she said, “$150 U.S. dollars per person.”My initial reaction (in my head) was, “Yeah, fuck that.” However, wewereon vacation.The next morning, I asked our tour guide if he knew anything about the show and if it was worth the obscene price. Immediately, his eyes lit up, and he assured us it was fantastic and absolutely worth every penny. He endorsed the show so enthusiastically I decided to splurge on it against my better judgement.The last night we were in Thailand, we bought tickets to the 11pm showing. After having a few warm up drinks in our hotel room, we made our way downstairs. I expected to walk into a cramped, seedy basement, but the stage and stadium seating were bigger than the auditorium in my high school. The light and sound systems must have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. It was almost as impressive as the Moulin Rouge!When we entered, a sharply dressed bellhop met us and led us to our seats. At that point, I was feeling guilty for arriving under-dressed for such a formal occasion, but I got over that with a little more liquid courage. As soon as we sat down, a waitress came by and sold us some overpriced beer and wine. Properly prepared, we settled in for a night we’d never forget.Halfway through my first beer, the overhead lights dimmed. A spotlight cracked on, illuminating a thin, middle aged Thai man wearing high heels, panty hose, panties, and a tasteful black corset. If you need a visual image, he basically looked like A Thai version of Tim Curry fromThe Rocky Horror Picture Show.…and that’s… interesting. Hey,  I traveled all the way to Thailand for a cultural experience, and I was getting exactly that. So I was rolling with it.Honestly, at first I was shocked, but then I was like, “Okay. What do you got for us, Tim?”Well, for the next two hours, in his adorably broken English, “Tim” introduced us to a parade of transvestites in various stages of the transition process who all regaled us by lip-singing American pop songs that you would have heard in an American strip club circa 2007.The whole time I remember thinking, “GOD DAMN IT! I DIDN’T COME ALL THE WAY TO THAILAND TO LISTEN TO AMERICAN POP MUSIC!”In between acts, a chorus line of big-booby corset-ed hot chicks (and more lingerie-clad men) would come out and do the can-can dance… or whatever.A dozen Thai beers later, the $300+ episode of the Twilight Zone ended. Tim and his friends took a bow. The spotlight shut off, and the overhead lights came on.Silently, my wife and I drifted upstairs to the lobby elevator. Then we took another elevator from the lob - the wise sloth | uncensored advice on life uncensored advice on life\",\n",

More often than not, it’s a death by PowerPoint boast about turnover, number of employees and a meaningless page of “big name logos” followed by a series of banal and self-serving “discovery questions” which all too rapidly are followed by a clumsy “feature blast” and product pitch that almost inevitably will end with a trail close of some sort or other.The customer is left feeling they’ve just wasted the last hour of their life, they’ve answered the same questions they always get asked and they’ve actually learnt or achieved nothing of tangible value that will help them in their role or with any of the things that challenge them day-to-day.So how can you make sure you’re not the next “terrible” “solution” selling product pusher who walks through the door?How can you stand out as being someone they are keen to open up to, are happy to meet again and someone they would choose to do business with over and above everyone else that’s knocking at their door?Well here are3 Killer Secrets to Successthat come directly from the very people you’re trying sell to…pay attention… they WANT you to know this stuff:1. You are NOT providing them with a SOLUTIONWhether you like it or not your beautifully packaged “solution” is simply acomponentas far as your customer is concerned. What you happily present as a complete package of products or services in reality has to fit into and alongside all manner of other such “packages” and myriad other internal and incumbent systems or processes that the person you’re selling to \\xa0has to consider, deal with and integrate, in order to get ANY value at all out of what you’re offering.Interestingly, not only do I KNOW this from having been told it by senior level decision makers over the years, but it is also backed up in extensive research by the Corporate Executive Board in their seminal bookThe Challenger Sale,\\xa0which evidences that in buying a “solution”, it is in fact the CUSTOMER that has to do all the work to customize your “solution” to integrate it into all the other elements they need to consider, BEFORE they can derive any value from it at all.So what do you need to know?Understand that the customer’s “problem” is bigger than your “solution”Prepare your proposition by considering this up front. How will you help the customer to buy and what do you need to incorporate in your offer to make what you’re presenting, easy to for them to implement?In the sales meeting or presentation make your INTEREST and UNDERSTANDING of your customer’s need to integrate your solution clear. Ask probing and empathetic questions that EVIDENCE you “get it”.2. DON’T Ask them “What Keeps you awake at night?”I know most sales people consider this to be a great way to get the customer to “open up” about where their pain points are. I can assure you that the same sales people haven’t got a clue that it not only drives your customer nuts, but it is actually damaging your chances of making any real progress.Why?Because it’s the same uninspired “out of the text-book” question that every other “clockwork” sales dummy they see that day will ask.It evidences that you haven’t got a clue about the person you’re speaking to. That you haven’t bothered to research them or their company or their industry enough to be able to ask anything even a little bit more tailored.It shows that to you, they are simply part of the “numbers game”. One more “pitch on the list” one more “no” on route to a “yes”. Do you think that makes you look like someone who could add value to the customer or someone they can’t wait to leave?Most Importantly though…it will get you the same answer the customer has given to every one of your competitors who’s been dumb enough to ask it! You won’t get any real insight, you won’t get any deep understanding of how you can position your offering to add real value, create real differentiation and to be able to sell at the highest price. You’ll just join the list of competitors selling something that can now be boiled down simply to price.So whatshouldyou do or ask?I suggest you aim for a conversation rather than a presentation. I suggest you do your homework when you develop your proposition (that’s themarketingbit) so that you can offer real insight and I suggest you make sure you’ve done your research on the people you’re meeting before you meet them. Design and discuss an idea or insight with them that both evidences your understanding of the wider issues and challenges THEY face, and enables them to think and talk expansively about how they might use it, change it, incorporate it into their business. You and THEY will get a good deal more from a meeting when you do this than if you turn up with a “solution” you need to “punt” at the first sign of any “need” you can match it to.Again,The Challenger Saleis great at helping you explore this. I also use theBusiness Model Canvasand of courseSureFire Excellencefor preparing propositions that make this work brilliantly and open up much bigger opportunities more quickly.3. Who’s really BUYING?It probably goes without saying (I hope) that in most instances and where you’re selling a complex or big-ticket service or solution, there will be more than one person or department involved in the decision to buy.A well constructed value proposition will provide the sales person with the tools they need to engage and talk confidently to each and every member of the \\xa0Decision Making Unit. It should also enable the sales person to make the proposition relevant, valuable and a priority decision for each party too.The real key here though is to understand how the decision process really works. And be aware…it’s changed since you last looked at it. Again (and I’m not on commission here!) but the Challenger Sales research evidences that post recession, just about all big-ticket decisions are now made by consensus. Be clear, that’s important. A few years ago when you were selling to one “department head” or VP you could be sure if you closed them, the deal was done.Not any longer. Now even the most senior of decision makers will reach out to their peers across the business as well as down into their team to gain consensus before going ahead. Buyers (as individuals) are now highly risk averse. So be prepared.Here are a few pointers:ASK and understand how the decision is to be made up front.Determine (and you should do this when you develop your proposition) how you will HELP your customer to take and sell YOUR Proposition UP and across into the business.Make sure you know and understand what the CFO/FD’s top priorities are this year. Unless what you’re selling addresses one of those, you will be in for an uphill battle.Find out what the CFO/FD (The business) sets as their “hurdle rates” – this is important. These are the terms or criteria set by the CFO/FD for any business case or proposition that comes across their desk for approval. If your proposition doesn’t get over the hurdles, it doesn’t even get to first base.Those are the top three things I think you need to know and consider when selling solutions.What doyouthink?PS: I can help you think differently about your sales and marketing approaches.

Honestly, I love it!I havea businessthat allows me to spend my days working with companies to help them find smarter, quicker, more sustainable ways of growingtheirbusiness. Sure we may use different terms of reference, we may call it new business generation or key account selling or proposition development or any and all of those things. And the company I work with could be an SME or a start-up, but it can just as easily be a household name enterprise. Guess what…they all have broadly the same problems and face roughly the same sorts of challenges.That’s all great and it keeps me very busy indeed, but so what?Well it also means that I work with and come across no end of absolutely brilliant companies, great new tools and fantastic content and ideas that I think you, my prized and highly valued reader (stumble across(er)/stalker/passing interest(er)/competitor) really ought to know about.So I thought I’d take a few moments to share a few of them with you now. I hope you find them useful.Oh and for the cynical among you, you will notice no affiliate links here…no money changes hands…this is all just honest goodness!1. Pipeliner SalesThis is a fantastic new Pipeline monitoring and management solution that (for once) was designed with the sales person in mind. Really easy to use for both the sales teams and those that manage them, this simple system uses drag and drop inputs to provide easily understandable and configurable dashboards and reports. I use this with a growing number of my clients. If you want to know more, get hold of Richard Young, he’s the UK MD and a thoroughly decent chap too…richard.young@pipelinersales.com2. Digi-Products.ComAn easy way to build, personalize, send, track and monitor digital content of pretty much any kind.Digi is deceptively brilliant. I’ve been using it and recommending it for years. Over that time the wonderful founder and CEO, David Boyland (officially the nicest bloke you’ll ever meet) has developed it into one of the cleverest tools on the market today. Don’t make the mistake many marketing people do of thinking you can already do this stuff…you’re missing the point. Digi is great for lead generation and supporting the sales dialogue, for managing internal communications and even for tracking proposals and invoices. For the marketing team, it’s brilliant for giving everyone access to standard collateral that they can personalize to suit each requirement without messing with the brand guidelines! Oh….it may save you a fortune on creative costs too!3. SalesformicsBe quick to get in on the beta deal for this one. I have to say I predict a riot with this product. It should turn the CRM and Marketing Automation world upside down. Guess what…it was designed to be easy to use by people like you and me. It does everything you would want it to do….but it’s really easy to use. Better than that, it’s not some old-time, clunky CRM tool that’s had a few knobs and whistles added to bring it up to date. This is a product built and designed specifically for the market we all work in today. Stewart Rogers is the Head of Product, he too is a top chap and he’d be happy to give you a demo! Ask him to show you the segment marketing and workflow processes…it’s so easy even I am interested enough to do it…and I really hate using these things.4. NearDeskNearDesk is as genius as the man who founded it, Tom Ball. A really simple card, internet site and soon to come app, that provides you or your sales team with access to a desk and office facilities by the hour pretty much where ever you are in the UK. What’s better still is that it strips out all that wasted time and resource invested in processing expense claims for desks, space, WiFi and coffee! Each person simply swipes in and out and all the invoices are consolidated and itemized and sent to your office once a month for processing. It’s growing like Topsy and so it should, it’s brilliant. I’ve got a NearDesk card, have you?5. CopyBloggerWithout doubt the most informative and well constructed resource for anyone interested in content and digital marketing. It’s (mainly) free so I suggest you check it out. And if you blog for a living or if you want to improve the effectiveness of the content you produce, I’d recommend you look at theirScribesolution too.I hope you find the time to check them out…and I hope you find them useful.

Of course some people prefer a one to oneworkshopon site…we do that too and for those that aren’t quite sure what they need we’ve put in an easy and honest self-assessment.

They will of course be only too happy to sell you what it is they do.That’s actually where your problems usually start.I’m not for one moment suggesting the agency or service provider is not good at what they do, or that they are anything other than well intention-ed. Iamsuggesting however that many SME organisations aren’t actually sure what it is they really need and therefore what they really ought to\\xa0buy and from whom.For many, marketing (and in some instances sales) is a real afterthought or seen as a necessary evil and certainly an overhead.That means that they almost always leave doing anything about it until it’s too late…Too Little Too LateAnd then it’s a case of too little budget and far too little time to do anything about it.Of course, what ever service provider you bring in at that stage will “fail”.Marketing is “the long game”, it’s a discipline that requires skill and investment and time. If you give it that, then it won’t cost you a fortune and itwillwork. If you confuse it withmagic…and expect it to pull a rabbit out of the hat in no time at all and for no money invested, then you will be very disappointed indeed.You don’t need to spend a fortune on marketing or to panic and push out vast campaigns at enormous cost while you cross your fingers and hope for the orders to come in.You need to plan to invest in an intelligent, progressive and iterative dialogue with your audience. If you do that well enough and consistently enough you will be amazed how little you will need to spend on turning that audience from educated and interested into a sale and maybe even an advocate.Share this:RedditTwitterFacebookEmailLinkedInPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inSales and MarketingTaggedMarketing Agency,New Business Generation,SME Marketing,SME SalesJan·02Small Businesses need help with Digital\\xa0MarketingPosted byowenashby0Too many small and medium-sized businesses (SME) run the risk of being left behind simply because they have no idea how or indeed if, they should be embracing things like content marketing, digital marketing and social media marketing.Traditional and more established businesses and professions have resisted the temptation to get drawn in or to jump on what looks to be a bandwagon, but the truth is that today customers find, research and select the people and companies they choose more often than not based on some sort of internet research.Sure that “internet research” might mean a simple Google search or a recommendation from a friend or colleague via Facebook or LinkedIN but it’s just as likely to mean reading a well placed and well written article on a subject they’re interested in.With such a wealth of information, advice and opinion at their fingertips, prospective customers can arm themselves with product or service knowledge, supplier and price comparisons and pretty much everything the need to know to narrow down their search to just a few potential providers.On that basis how would you or your organisation fare?A well designed and consistently and competently executed Digital Marketing program will act like a magnet, positioning you in prospective customers’ minds and pulling informed and qualified buyers to your website.It can be confusing. It looks like there’s a lot to learn, a lot to achieve and potentially even a lot of money to be wasted if you don’t know what you’re doing.So where should you start?Could you do it yourself and when is it right to outsource it to the professionals?To help you address those very questions, I’ve teamed up with a technical and creative expert in the space,Rick O’Neiland together he and I have developed a completelyfreeand entirely comprehensive on line course for anyone looking to develop their own digital marketing, content marketing or social media marketing program.You can sign up for ithereFor those who would prefer aworkshopto discover what it all means and how to do it yourself, you can find ithereIf you think “Sod it, life’s too short and I want the experts to do it” you can find theoutsourceoptionhereAND…if you really don’t know what you should do….here’saready reckonerto help you decide.I hope it helps!Share this:RedditTwitterFacebookEmailLinkedInPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inNew Things Worth Checking Out,Sales and MarketingTaggedContent Marketing,Digital Marketing,Free,Outsource,Social Media,WorkshopNov·22Where do the big deals get\\xa0done?Posted byowenashby2Where do you think the really big deals get done?If you want to win the really big deals. If you want to command the premium price and if you want to build mile-high barriers to entry for your competitors, then you need to be on the inside looking out, rather than the outside looking in.Metaphorically speaking, most organisations invest all their time and energy running round the outside of the building trying to pick off a few easy wins and hoping that by process of osmosis and hard work, they will eventually make their way in and beyond the reception desk and maybe into the elevator and just maybe into an office or two.Phew.And when they get there, what they find is that they now join the long queue of their competitors who have also been on the same journey and invested them same effort and resources to get to the same place.And then what?Then they all have the same conversations with the same sort of people about the same sort of stuff. And it doesn’t matter if your “thing” is better, or faster or does more stuff …you will now be lobbying for your rightful share of mind and share of thesame budgetand eventually (if you’re lucky) you may just get a chance to under-cut the competitor in front of you.Great job……..meantime.In an office of someone no one else gets to speak to, another company is shaking hands on a huge deal that you and your fellow competitors never had a clue about. Price will be premium and never in question and customer will never for one moment have considered that there may be other companies out there he should approach as an alternative.Why?The company he’s shaking hands with never planned to get into the elevator and to join the queue to pitch an alternative to the person with the budget for the known and well understood \\xa0requirement.Instead, that company invested in a very real and very deep understanding of the customer. It found and learnt about the problems, ambitions, challenges and drivers that were core to the customer but wouldmake no sense at allto the competitors looking from the outside, simply trying to find a quick way to sell their products or services. It sought to work with and help the customer address one singular but significant problem.That problem was so close to the customer that “solving it” hadn’t yet been tasked out to the various departments to “go and find me a X”….that would mean all those in the queue could have a go at pitching for it.It never got that far.It never left the boardroom at all.And of course, having solved that one seemingly arcane but significant problem, the company is able to extend their engagement and open up the rest of their products and services as a trusted adviser/partner or collaborator. They will go on to build deeper, wider and higher barriers to entry and the queue of reps in the hall way will be left with less and less to fight over.If you’re looking for the big deals at the premium prices, they are not to be found where all your competitors are looking.Being on the “inside” doesn’t require decades of investment and years of research or countless hours at networking events.It requires a different approach to your preparation and the way you develop your proposition. Most of all it requires a willingness to stop doing what everyone else is doing and assuming if you know a few buzz words and few hot buttons “it’ll do”…because it won’t. \\xa0You’ll sound like an opportunist and you’ll be given your place in the queue behind all the other competitors.This week I have seen one organisation moving from a position of “also ran” to one where they could be the “supplier of choice” in a vast and hugely profitable market simply by taking this approach. \\xa0It will have cost them a great deal less and was in fact a great deal quicker than the usual approach they would have taken to “join the queue”.I suspect you could achieve that too.Share this:RedditTwitterFacebookEmailLinkedInPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inSales and MarketingTaggedChallenger Sales,Market Entry,Sales AccelerationNov·21Be relevant – be specific – be quick about\\xa0itPosted byowenashby0Check this out as a sales pitch:“We are brilliant at IT. We’ve got loads of big customers and loads of staff and more offices than you. What ever you want or need when it comes to IT you should come to us because we’re brilliant. We are better than you at it. We are probably a bit better than our competitors (or at least we will try harder) and we have great brochures, oh by the way – what keeps you awake at night?”Are you sold?I didn’t think so.This, however, is what 99% of the propositions customers hear sound like to them.Well actually they really sound a bit more like “blah, blah, IT, blah, IT, blah, staff, blah, you, blah, blah, blah – same old question at the end”.Not only do these sorts of propositions net very little and have little impact, they are also highly forgettable and what’s worse entirely interchange-able. So “you” could be anybody, from any company, with any product or service.Assuming you want the end result of your conversation with a customer to net you a positive and enthusiastic next step, lock-out for your competitors and a ring-fenced and highly profitable opportunity for you, can I suggest you re-think how you’re presenting your proposition?No onebuysIT (insert your “thing”).People are looking to achievea desired outcomefor themselves or for their business and they are looking for ways they can achieve thatdesired outcomeas quickly, cost effectively and in as risk-free manner as possible.The desired outcome is wheretheir focusis, it’s wherethe budget sitsand it’s where you willget their attention.People will pay the company who can help themachieve that outcome.Is that what you can do?Is it?Good.Well tell themthatthen.Theydon’t careabout anything else.PS:If you’re really smart, you’ll also check out this article from HBR aboutthe end of Solution Selling– it’sGold Dustand it’s what I help companies do.To my total delight one of the sales people I asked to read it this week, did…and tohis delighthe put it into immediate use in front of a high value and high-profile prospect andit worked.See – I do know what I’m talking about, honest.You may also enjoy this article I wrote forSurefire Excellenceabout being credible in your market…Share this:RedditTwitterFacebookEmailLinkedInPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inSales and MarketingTaggedChallenger Sales,HBR,Sales Propositions,Solution Selling,SureFire ExcellenceNov·08Big News – Prospects MAY be\\xa0HumanPosted byowenashby0I don’t expect global recognition or a knighthood for pointing out the blindingly obvious, but it doesn’t hurt from time to time to be reminded that the people you want to connect with, engage, sell to or “reach out” to are in fact as individual, diverse, weird, worried, driven, motivated, nuts, stressed, arrogant, confident, busy, lazy, overworked, underpaid or hugely successful (take your pick) as you are.It’s a fact. They too are real live, breathing humans.When they go home they do things just like you do. Like make the dinner, pick up the kids, walk the dog, do the ironing, watch the soap opera…If you’re careful and observant you may even see one or two of them out and about. In the supermarket or at the cinema. They will have the same debates as you and I do with our family or partners about what we will eat this evening or what we’ll do at the weekend.The problem is that if you allow yourself to, it’s very easy for Marketing to see your prospects or your customers as a Unique ID on a CRM system or an “inbound, unqualified lead” or perhaps more so today they will be simply an MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) or an SQL (Sales Qualified Lead).Sales are just the same. They often see the prospect or client as The IT Director, The CFO, The Office Manager of the Head of HR.Interestingly these are not the same labels these people would naturally apply to themselves.Add into that the “Buyer Persona” that you’ve spent time and energy crafting and all of a sudden your poor prospect or customer is not only an MQL /Head of HR but you have now applied all sorts prejudices and generalizations to them – issues/drivers/challenges/etc.Of course there’s a good deal of logic in segmenting and organizing your data, after all we’re all trying to build a “Customer Factory” right? (Ash Maurya) but when you’re doing that, keep in mind that the same Unique Codes and Matrix categorizations are being made about you too.

Everyone gets a pat on the back and sits back and waits for the orders to roll in.Sometimes they do.Most of the time they don’t or (what’s probably worse) what comes in is not what you expected at all, in fact every order is different and needs a different set of services, skills and products to serve it and likely they will deliver cash at different rates and profit that’s all over the place too.In most instances it just doesn’t really deliver what you expect it to. I know personally of global corporations who spend vast sums on programs that net no business at all – I bet you do too.So what’s the problem?Well there’s a little more to it than meets the eye…but…guess who wasn’t invited to the planning meetings or workshops. Guess who’s input and views and experience you didn’t take into consideration.Strangely the last person organisations are happy to talk to when it comes to building new programs or propositions, is the customer.It’s bizarre. It’s actually as if the marketing team are afraid to ask to meet with and speak to the customers or even perhaps that it didn’t dawn on them to ask at all.I met with a very senior executive from a global corporation last month who told me that often his team would come to him and say “what do you think about this value proposition?”. And his answer was “why do you care what I think?”…”One thing I can guarantee you is that I am never going to buy it”. “Have you asked any customers?”. …..Share this:RedditTwitterFacebookEmailLinkedInPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inSales and MarketingTaggedCustomer,Value PropositionOct·17More Sales People = More Sales…..\\xa0Right?Posted byowenashby0I’ve just finished one of the sorts of conversations that stop you dead in your tracks.I had been discussing a particular challenge I come across a lot in companies of all sizes today.

Knock Em DownHaving been a Quiet Riot fan since forever I have to say I was quite intrigued when I heard they had hired James Durbin as their new vocalist. I had been paying attention and waiting for the new record to drop when, to my surprise, I received a preview copy of Road Rage in my inbox.Not sure what to expect from 2017 lineup of Frankie Banali (drums), Chuck Wright (bass), Alex Grossi (guitars), and James Durbin (vocals) I quickly found myself picking my ass up off the floor upon listening to it.The songs on Road Rage take me back to the days when groove laden rock was the norm, and yet these tracks have a freshness to them. There are homages to 70’s and 80’s bands throughout this record that make it a comfortable, yet head banging listen.There are those who have proclaimed the death of Rock and Roll as we know and love it. I would say to them, “Listen to the new Quiet Riot record Road Rage and get back with me on that.”Stand out tracks for me include: “Can’t Get Enough”, “Getaway”, “Still Wild”, and “Knock Em Down”.As expected Frankie lays down a solid bed for the rest of the band to build upon. Chuck rounds out Frankie’s drumming with a heavy bottom end. Alex walks his guitar all over the map and if you listen you will hear the talent that this man has. James had his work cut out for him by laying vocals over such amazingly crafted music, and he pulled it off, and then some.The record officially drops on 08/04/17 on \\xa0Frontiers Music s.r.l. and I will for sure be ordering a copy to support hard working musicians to keep doing what they do and what we love.I would give this a solid 8 out of 10 stars.it’s loud, it’s dirty, it’s QUIET RIOT(so BANG YOUR HEAD)-the HellionShare this:FacebookTwitterEmailPinterestTumblrPocketLinkedInRedditPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inArtist,Bassists,Blues,Classic Metal,Classic Rock,Drummer,Glam,Guitarists,Heavy metal,Internet Radio,Legends,Metal,Music,Rock,Rock N' Roll,RockStar,Sleaze,Surrealist,Tattoos,Vocalist,Whiskey Metal.TaggedAlex Grossi,Chuck Wright,FRANKIE BANALI,Frontier Records,James Durbin,Metal,Music,Quiet Riot,Road RageMarty Casey – A Rock N’ Roll\\xa0ChampionMay 21, 2017byjanaya640Sometimes people cross your paths and leave a positive impact on you.

My reasoning is that I do not feel it adequately represents reality. I think that if they want a REAL version they should put it to vote to the people who are listening to that particular genre of music. Now, on to the Metallica/GaGa performance.Because I was asked I looked online and saw the performance. In my opinion it was a train wreck from the get go. I think that it was someone’s grand idea to try and cross pollinate fans of Lady GaGa and Metallica. While I feel, both are great performers on their own, they added nothing to each other. I was also bothered by the “mosh pit” dancers on stage. It seemed too contrived, any one of you who has been “caught in a mosh” know what I mean. As for the technical glitches, hey it’s Rock N’ Roll and we have ALL lived through them.All in all, it was painful for me to watch.

It was not mainstream at all. Eventually it became widely accepted and part of our culture.Rock radio helped to expose us to bands and music in ways like no other. There was a time when that was how we discovered new bands and songs. Record stores popped up everywhere and one could hang out and explore and find new music as well. We then had the arrival of music video channels which gave us another source to discover new bands and music.Then radio became less user friendly and more commercial, only playing what they were told. The record stores began closing their doors. Music video channels stopped playing music videos. What happened?The internet had come along and was added into the thick of things. Some people put the blame on that.What happened to the music world? Is there still great new music being made? How does one find new music these days? I mean with all the music being flooded onto the web how does one find that jewel that reaches out to you?Do you think that some of the bands we all know and love would have made it if they had just started out in today’s world?I often wonder if the next Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, etc. etc. \\xa0is out there lost in the shuffle.Just some thoughts I was pondering… what are yours?-the HellionShare this:FacebookTwitterEmailPinterestTumblrPocketLinkedInRedditPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inArtist,Bassists,Blues,Classic Metal,Classic Rock,Drummer,Glam,Guitarists,Heavy metal,Internet Radio,Keyboards,Legends,Metal,Music,Outlaw Metal,Punk,Rock,Rock N' Roll,RockStar,Sleaze,Surrealist,Tattoos,Thrash Metal,Vocalist,Whiskey Metal,Words.TaggedAlternative Rock,Blues,Death Metal,Gothic,Heavy Metal,Metal,Music,Rock,Thrash MetalStephen Pearcy talks\\xa0SMASHFebruary 4, 2017byjanaya640Well, It’s a new year and I’ve taken some time off to try and gather my wits about me in this turbulent world.

I was pleasantly surprised to see a line had already formed in front of the building. I made my way towards the door and sorted out my entry so I could prepare to shoot the evening’s festivities.The people who had purchased the pre show meet and greet (there were quite a few of them) were finishing up and allowed to form a line in the lobby. The sound check was starting up and I decided to walk around and visit with the fans. I was shown various items that had been signed (one cool item was an original vinyl copy of To Hell With The Devil.Steve Civerolo with his dad PaulOverall there was a sense of love for Stryper. I found it very cool to see people I knew to be fans of various Hard Rock bands that one usually does not associate with Stryper, telling me how much they meant to them. One special moment for me was seeing my good friend Derek Leyba be given the opportunity to help with load in for the band. The joy in his eyes was immensely satisfying.Derek LeybaI went back in and found\\xa0the band taking their time with the sound check to get it right. The thing that impressed me was the fact that they were willing to take that extra time to give their fans a high-quality show. Eventually everyone was satisfied with the sound check and whisked off to don the Black and Yellow.I began my set up in the photo pit and waited for the crush of the crowd when the doors were opened. Funny thing, that didn’t happen. People were kind and civil as they packed in. I saw many friends of mine and many hugs were given. Then, the lights went down and business was about to begin.The show began with a cool video history of Stryper which led into a countdown. When the lights came there they were, in their Black and Yellow glory, STRYPER!!!Michael SweetRobert SweetOz FoxTim GainesThey took us back to 1986 instantly as they played through To Hell With The Devil in its entirety. The band was spot on not missing a lick of the album they had created so many years ago. Song after song was delivered and it seemed the band grew more energetic as did the crowd. After completing the album To Hell With The Devil Stryper ran through some of their crowd favorites and some more current songs. I can definitely say that they left the crowd satisfied. \\xa0 There was a very cool moment during the set when Michael was talking to the crowd and one guy professed his love of the band and you could hear it in his voice.For moments here and there I actually felt like I was a 22-year-old again watching them for the first time. The playing, the vocals, the stage and the costumes were perfect. I am so very pleased to see that the years have only made them a better, stronger band. If you have the chance do yourself a favor and catch Stryper on this tour, you will NOT be disappointed!Thanks Michael Sweet, Robert Sweet, Oz Fox, and Tim Gaines for a great time and a reminder of how the music community should treat each other.it’s\\xa0the Yellow and Black Attack, it’s STRYPER!!!– the HellionShare this:FacebookTwitterEmailPinterestTumblrPocketLinkedInRedditPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inArtist,Bassists,Blues,Classic Metal,Classic Rock,Drummer,Glam,Guitarists,Heavy metal,Internet Radio,Legends,Metal,Music,Rock,Rock N' Roll,RockStar,Surrealist,Vocalist,Words.TaggedAlbuquerque,Albuquerque NM,Derek Leyba,Lobo Theater,Metal,Michael Sweet,Music,New Mexico,NM,Oz Fox,Paul Civerolo,Robert Sweet,Rock,Steve Civerolo,Stryper,the Hellion,the Hellion Rocks,Timothy Gaines,To Hell With The DevilAdam Joad talks Swamp Rebel\\xa0Machine!!October 14, 2016byjanaya640Grab a cold one, crank up the volume, and enjoy my conversation with the one, the only, Appalachian Apostle: ADAM JOAD from Scattered Hamlet.After listening go towww.scatteredhamlet.comand preorder Swamp Rebel Machine!!!it’s loud, it’s dirty, it Scattered Hamlet!!!-the HellionShare this:FacebookTwitterEmailPinterestTumblrPocketLinkedInRedditPrintLike this:LikeLoading...Posted inArtist,Bassists,Blues,Classic Metal,Classic Rock,Drummer,Glam,Guitarists,Heavy metal,Internet Radio,Legends,Metal,Music,Outlaw Metal,Punk,Rock,Rock N' Roll,RockStar,Sleaze,Surrealist,Tattoos,Vocalist,Whiskey Metal.TaggedAdam Joad,Adam Newell,Alternative Rock,Blues,Jake Delling Le Bas,Metal,Music,Richard Erwin,Rock,Scattered Hamlet,Swamp Rebel Machine,the Hellion,the Hellion RocksPost navigation←Older postsSearchRecent PostsBob Kulick talks Skeletons In The\\xa0ClosetFrankie Banali talks ROAD\\xa0RAGE!!!QUIET RIOT – ROAD\\xa0RAGEMarty Casey – A Rock N’ Roll\\xa0Championtalking with Robert Mason of\\xa0WARRANTArchivesAugust 2017July 2017May 2017February 2017October 2016September 2016August 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014October 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014March 2014February 2014January 2014December 2013November 2013October 2013September 2013August 2013July 2013June 2013May 2013April 2013March 2013February 2013January 2013December 2012November 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012CategoriesArtistBassistsBluesClassic MetalClassic RockDrummerGlamGuitaristsHeavy metalInternet RadioKeyboardsLegendsMetalMusicOutlaw MetalPunkRockRock N' RollRockStarSleazeSlender ManSlendermanSurrealistTattoosThrash MetalUncategorizedUrban legendsVocalistWhiskey MetalWordsWornstar ClothingFollow Blog via EmailEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.Email Address:FollowJoin 1,302 other subscribersthe Hellion Rocks on Facebook!the Hellion Rocks on Facebook!the Hellion RocksBob Kulick talks Skeletons In The ClosetFrankie Banali talks ROAD RAGE!!!QUIET RIOT – ROAD RAGEMarty Casey – A Rock N’ Roll Championtalking with Robert Mason of WARRANTMetallica/Lady GaGaWhere Do We Go From Here?Stephen Pearcy talks SMASHSTRYPER – To Hell With The Devil tour 2016 – 10/23/16 Albuquerque, NMAdam Joad talks Swamp Rebel Machine!!BlogrollDiscussGet InspiredGet PollingGet SupportLearn WordPress.comTheme ShowcaseWordPress PlanetWordPress.com NewsCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.the Hellion   RocksCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.FollowFollowingthe Hellion   RocksJoin 42 other followersSign me upAlready have a WordPress.com account?Log in now.the Hellion   RocksCustomizeFollowFollowingSign upLog inReport this contentView site in ReaderManage subscriptionsCollapse this barLoading Comments...Write a Comment...Email (Required)Name (Required)Website%dbloggers like this: - the hellion   rocks | rock n'roll has never died, we're just getting ready for another set. rock n'roll has never died, we're just getting ready for another set.\",\n",

One starts with the design, conceptual imagination, and the architecture to achieve poetic character. The second is to implement, in order to tectonic grammar. The first function is run by studio RAW Architecture, and the second one is performed by DOT Workshop. The two of them create a symbiosis of method and implementation. To complete the synergy, the last one is the case for reflection is the archive OMAH Library presents to produce reflection of knowledge.

I write and curate the information so that it’s easy to understand, and the studio tries to experiment to bring innovation and more understanding to the projects.I credit the teamwork, noting that several beautiful people who are critical and creative craftsmen, designers, supervisors, and clients have contributed to the body of work. My grandfather and father started the builder’s ecosystem before, and I extended it and focused on architecture. Please have a look at the name and contributors below, and I appreciate the effort collaboratively. I am updating this story quite often, so please have a visit.I established the studio Realrich Architecture Workshop in 2011. We are actively designing a specific approach to building interested in locality and craftmanship to define an architecture that is simple, humble, has no pretension, and has the quality of transcendence. We have three streams in our studio, RAW Architecture focussed on poetic architecture, DOT Workshop on management by design, and Omah Library on disseminating architecture knowledge to the public.Our projects strive for the uniqueness and humble character of local material. The studio’s vision is about making basic architecture, and we call it raw in its look, the process to make artisanal quality. It’s the belief that experimentation of design methods developed wholeheartedly will create such a timeless, surreal, and mastering grade in its simplest form, most straightforward approach.We re-established the long history of craftsmanship in my builder’s family, lasting for three generations, and 60 years of practice since Indonesia’s Independence. At that time, the practice has no name. The relationship between the supervisors and artisans was intimate and personal to the service ecosystem. It’s the phase in a noname, more common sense, and massive trust by clients and collaborators. It’s the world of colonials and post colonial’s culture.The practice is well known for trust, quality, and its authentic and basic design innovation in the mastery of building construction. Our approach revived the harmonic relationship between the craftsman, designer, people, and buildings as a whole. The works have become the manifestation of this belief. Please have a look, and enjoy the process described below.You can read the firm’s ecosystem, the collaborative team in the section of project stories, design method, and research in the link below about the section frontstage :Project StoriesDesign MethodResearchBest Office in the WorldIn the story section backstage, you can find a more detailed story about the initiation of the studio and all of its transformative years.

We started the design by listen to the client, nature, site. It’s a reflective and collaborative process.  We asked so many questions just to formulate ideas. Then test it on the design attempts.  When the mind wonders, and the hand sketches the ideas. Designing is truly magical process which starts by training yourself even years before the design starts. I call this process like dealing in the kitchen,  the formulation of the recipe’s process. It’s the fundamental steps which is important.  At the end, all of these is technical skills that is transformed all the way in designer’s life.Bioclimatic DesignThe most critical part in the design process is on forming the design that seamlessly harmony with nature. This evolution process is about integrating passive sustainable and technology to optimalise usage of energy and water through architecture technique.Philosophical ThinkingThen the design is tested for forms iterations. We love to build combination of platonic and curvilinear form. Because somehow it has dialogue with some primitive form that color the history. I fond of circle, the moon gate in Hangzhou, even some of the opening of the cave. This form actually is a manifestation of mind, the allegory of the Plato’s cave. This process is whole preparation stage in architect’s mind before designing.Functional Space DesignThe next stage is starting to understand the context, it’s a process to listen to others. This is the step to formulate space program by asking questions and propose many hypothesis to the project. Then this space program is adapted to space planning by integrating the program to decent layout with flow of people, furniture, and how people are going to use the spaceTectonic DesignThis is the process where we have dialogue with craftsmen before deciding. Ussualy we have contacted very specific craftsmen to discuss the execution of details. I love to explore as a way to enrich my heritage and simplify the solutions. This is the process of dialogue between material to one another. This is the process when an intensive design and build process occurs. My parent has ecosystem that is been iterated since Indonesia’s Independence.Back to Top | Kembali ke MenuCollective Cave & Bioclimatic HomeDesign MethodCollective Cave & Bioclimatic HomeUnderstanding Landscape ArchitectureIn-Depth Architecture(Will be updated)Design UniverseInspiring PeopleProject Process and stories : the soul of the hand , the mind, and the SpiritWe curated the projects based on the time they are finished in one cycle of agreements with clients and reflection of the moments of life around me and my team. The idea is to illustrate the process as one relations one to another in matter of clients, my personal view, and the relation that I have with my family and my team. This section is on constant updates.There are 2 type of projects, one is The Collective Cave. This type consists of projects that has relations to certain brand identity which relate to collective effort in society. The second type is Bioclimatic Home that consists of personal space, a home that have high performance on sustainable design.In term of transformation, there are also 3 phases :Phase 0 | 2000 – 2010 : The Fool’s ProgressThis is the moment where I learn by doing, and get inspired by many people. I scribble and wonders about myself, Trying to find love in architecture. I got my passion in this process and learning that architecture has two ways, for yourself and for others. Many of projects in this phase is the result of my foolish take on the process of my training becoming architect.Phase 1 | 2010 – 2020 : Fire Sparks The PassionWe designed so many projects with client’s and intensive engineers and design team as a way to explore and sharpen the technique. This is the first phase or architecture has a strong layers of technique such as programs, context, and ideas. Many of projects in this phase is the first 20 years of my practice. It closed with Covid as pivotal moment.Phase 2 | 2020 – next 2030 : Magic AlchemyIt is the phase that we are in now that we tried to bring ourself deeper to architectonic way which I define RAW Architecture culture after Covid – 19. It is a way to understand others through architecture. This phase is the phase of building alchemy or “magical relationship and responsibility” with others.About Bioclimatic Home and Collective Cave?For me, the typology of architecture is defined by two mainstreams, one is for personal use, and the other one is for collective purpose. The goal of the personal project is to address someone’s individual needs, character, and expressions yet their own philosophy of life. I believe several values in life that can reflect on architecture. That’s what I share with beautiful individuals in our practice. The project is very customized, and the goal is to make a home for the client.When we think about the objective to make a home, we should be reminded that in earth, our resources are limited, and the specificity of the location makes the project unique. The materials, the skin, the internal configuration, and the building envelope orientation will be very important. The use of energy and water will be reflected from someone’s life to their ecosystem. That is why I call this one a bioclimatic home. It’s time to combine individual expression and sensitivity towards the earth with it’s limited resources.The bioclimatic means a building that’s surrounded by the needs, the shadow of the trend, desire, the ambitions. The cave itself is an example of the quest to find the importance of others rather than business, fame, and ambitions to be successful. To be successful mean to make an understated collective cave that can be a memorable place and have a high-performance bioclimatic concept.The second project is about the journey of serving as humans for the collective soul, sometimes we make architecture for other people to, let’s say, impress them, make the place for sale, make the place for comfort like a space for memory. We call this typical project, a collective project. We share similar goals and identities that bond us as humans who enjoy architecture.The cave is a result from the intersection of limited sources and we as a human who need to have shelter, therefore, we try to have architecture. The resources should be limitedly use and critically towards the building of the architecture.Collective CaveThis type consists of projects that has relations to certain brand identity which relate to collective effort in society.Collective Cave 408 – School of Alfa\\xa0OmegaAlpha Omega school is an educational building with the spirit of locality.

Caravel\\xa0baseball\\ufeffhttps://www.delawareonline.com/story/sports/high-school/2023/01/26/delaware-coach-of-the-year-kristin-caldwell-to-lead-caravel-baseball/69837667007/Kristin Caldwell’s narrative:I was hired as the varsity baseball coach at Caravel Academy in Delaware back in December. Two coaches ago I was coach Paul Niggebrugge’s assistant coach at Caravel for 11 seasons.My background is in baseball. I played t-ball on up, all the way through playing high school baseball at Caravel in the late 90’s. We won the Delaware state championship in 1998. I played basketball at the University of Delaware and then was fortunate enough to pitch in 3 women’s World Cups for the USA Women’s National team.I was previously the girls basketball coach here for 16 years. Last year I retired after we won the 2022 state championship. I have an 8th grade son, so when the baseball job opened up this fall the timing seemed right, and I applied.Very very blessed to be the baseball coach at Caravel. I love this school and the baseball program so much!Rate this:Share this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Like this:LikeLoading...January 27, 2023girlsplaybaseballGirl BaseballOne of Our Heroes: Ila Borders | Lavender\\xa0Magazinehttps://lavendermagazine.com/our-scene/ila-borders/Rate this:Share this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Like this:LikeLoading...January 27, 2023girlsplaybaseballGirl BaseballBaseball, baseball, baseball – The Suburban\\xa0Timeshttps://thesubtimes.com/2023/01/26/baseball-baseball-baseball/Rate this:Share this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Like this:LikeLoading...January 27, 2023girlsplaybaseballGirl BaseballWomen in Baseball Week – A worldwide celebration of women and girls in\\xa0baseballhttps://womeninbaseballweek.org/Rate this:Share this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Like this:LikeLoading...January 25, 2023girlsplaybaseballGirl Baseball‘Brilliant, funny, quirky’: Former Chronicle columnist Gwen Knapp dies at\\xa061https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/article/Brilliant-funny-quirky-Former-Chronicle-17734255.phpRate this:Share this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Like this:LikeLoading...January 23, 2023girlsplaybaseballGirl BaseballDiamondbacks hire Ronnie Gajownik as first female manager of a High-A\\xa0teamhttps://sports.yahoo.com/diamondbacks-hire-ronnie-gajownik-as-first-female-manager-of-a-high-a-team-221302924.htmlRate this:Share this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Like this:LikeLoading...January 21, 2023girlsplaybaseballGirl BaseballLike other women in baseball, Christina Whitlock has her own story to tell;
